The Usage of とんでもない


I will introduce the usage of とんでもない after receiving a request from my friend. 

とんでもない has mainly two usages.

1.
When とんでもない is used as an adjective, it means unbelievable/surprising/outrageous/terrible/awful etc.

I will show some examples.

とんでもないことが起こった、宝くじが当たった。
An unbelievable thing happened. I won the lottery.

彼はオリンピックでとんでもない記録を出した
He has set surprising records in the Olympic Game.

彼はとんでもないことを言った
He said outrageous things.


2. 
When we deny another's statement, we use とんでもない as an independent sentence. 

I can find the below examples in the dictionary.

「彼女にお会いになりましたか」「とんでもない」
“Have you met her?"—“Certainly not."

「もう終わったか」「とんでもない, まだ始めてもいない」.
“Have you finished?"—“On the contrary, I haven't yet begun."

「君は間違っている」「(間違ってるなんて)とんでもない」.
“You are mistaken."—“Mistaken, my foot!"
 

Some of you may not be able to understand why speaker says such a thing in the below examples,  even if you can understand these grammatically.

「りっぱなお家ですね」「とんでもない、汚くて恥ずかしいです」
"Your house is so big." - "No way! I'm ashamed that it is too small."

「高級そうな車ですね」「とんでもない、安物ですよ」
"What a luxurious looking car!." - "Are you kidding? It's a cheap one."

This is a Japanese custom. If we are praised from someone, we usually deny it. I know a person who is praised will say thank you in most of your country. Japanese people are glad in their heart, and of course, they didn't think that their house is too small or their car is cheap. 
In many cases, a person who praise says so, just as a lip service. We call this conversation お約束.
