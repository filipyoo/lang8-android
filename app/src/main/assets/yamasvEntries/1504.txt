Using せい

～せいで is used to describe a cause of a result. It has a negative nuance. It can follow either a noun or verb. When it follows a noun, you need to add の after the noun.

全然勉強しなかったせいで試験に落ちた。
- I failed the test because I hadn't studied at all.

彼はその薬のせいで死んだ。
- He died because of the medicine.

In a positive sentence, you need to say ～おかげで.

一生懸命勉強したおかげで試験に受かった。
- I passed the test because I had studied hard.

その薬のおかげで良くなった。
- I got better because of the medicine.


おかげで is sometimes used in a negative sentence as sarcasm.

彼のミスのおかげで今日は残業しないといけない。
- I have to work overtime today because of his mistakes.
Technically, ミスのせいで is correct and ミスのおかげで is incorrect, but ミスのおかげで is often used to make a cynical remark to him.
