Using The Listener's Name in a Conversation

Using あなた even though you know the listener's name sounds rude. 

- Where do you live?
If you are talking with tanaka-san, you should say 田中さんはどこに住んでいるんですか? It doesn't sound unnatural to use 田中さん every time instead of "you" during the conversation.

It could also sound rude to use あなた even when you don't know their name. You can simply say "どこに住んでいるんですか?" in the case. The listener easily understands that you are asking about them.
(The reason あなた appears in your textbook is just because sentences without the subject make English speakers, or other language speakers, confuse.)

Similarly, using あなた達 to call people also sounds rude. You should say みなさん, or みんな in a casual situation, instead.



When English speakers greet to someone, they usually seem to add the listener's name:
- Good morning, Ken.
- How are you? John.

However, Japanese people usually don't add the listener's name after simple greetings. If you say "田中さん、おはようございます" or "田中さん、調子はどうですか?," it sounds a little unnatural. They may think that you are going to start an important conversation. (If the listener doesn't notice you, it's natural to call their name to make them notice you.)
