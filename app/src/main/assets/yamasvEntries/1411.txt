Using お宅

オタク means "a nerd/geek." It follows a noun what you are into: コンピューターオタク, アニメオタク, ゲームオタク, etc. It has a negative nuance; it implies that you are not sociable and not interested in anything but something at all. オタク comes from お宅, which means "you." In 1980s, some people who like anime so much and don't like people call each other お宅 instead of their names because they are too shy to call their names. (Japanese people usually use the listener's name to mean "you.")


When you use お宅 to mean "you,"  it sounds very polite.

これはお宅の車ですか？
- Is this car yours?
(You shouldn't write オタク in katakana when you merely means "you." If you write "これはオタクの車ですか?" it could mean "Is this a nerd's car?")

お宅の息子さんは医者だそうですね。さぞかし自慢でしょう。
- I heard that your son is a doctor. You must be very proud of him.

お宅 is also used to mean "your house."

お宅はどちらですか？
- Where is your house?

豪華なお宅ですね。
- Your house is gorgeous.
(This Japanese sentence implies that you are talking about the listener's house.)
