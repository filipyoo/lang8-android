The Point of View When You Speak Japanese

One of the most different things between English and Japanese is the point of view when you describe what you see or what you experienced.

"The rain prevented me from going out."
This type of sentence, which has a thing as the subject and has the speaker as the object, is difficult for Japanese people who are not used to English.  
"その雨は私が外出するのを妨げた" would be a literal translation of it, but this Japanese sentence sounds very unnatural. Almost all Japanese people would say "(私は)雨で外出できなかった." We choose ourselves as the subject when we talk about ourselves, while you describe everything from the objective view in English. This is one of the reasons the subject "私は" is often omitted; the listener knows that the speaker always talks from their point of view, not the objective view.

Similarly:
"My teacher scolded me."
"先生は私を叱った" is grammatically correct, but sounds unnatural. Every native speaker would say "(私は)先生に叱られた."  

"A taxi hit me." 
"(私は)タクシーにはねられた" sounds more natural than "タクシーが私をはねた."
This is why we often use the passive form. 


For the same reason, "彼はうれしい" or "彼は日本に行きたい" sounds unnatural, while "私はうれしい" or "私は日本に行きたい" sounds natural. It's because you know what you feel or what you want, but you can't know what someone else feels or wants exactly; all you can do is to guess their feelings or desires from their expressions or behaviors. "彼はうれしそうだ" or "彼は日本に行きたがっている" sounds natural.
