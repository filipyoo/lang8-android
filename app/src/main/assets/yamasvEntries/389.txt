Casual Greetings in Japanese

Whey we see our friends for the first time in a while, many of us say "久しぶり!," and continue the following expressions.
元気? / 元気にしてた? / 調子はどう? - How are you?
最近どう? / なにか変わったことあった? - What's new?

Since all of them are just greetings and they don't have special meanings, you don't have to answer seriously. 
When they say "元気?," you can say "元気だよ(I'm fine)" or "まぁまぁ(So-so)."
When they ask "最近どう?" or "なにか変わったことあった?" and you don't have  anything new, one of a common answer is "相変わらずだよ(Nothing special)."


Polite Greetings

"ごぶさたしてます/ごぶさたしております" are very polite expressions to mean "久しぶり." When you call your clients for the first time in a while, you should use them. "お元気でしたか?" or "お元気にしてましたか" are polite expression of "How are you?" When we are asked that, we often say "はい、おかげさまで." 
"おかげさまで" means "thanks to you / I'm blessed / fortunately."
