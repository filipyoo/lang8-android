The Usage of 〜てきた


昨日、彼が電話をかけた。

This Japanese sentence is ambiguous, You don't know who he called yesterday. However, if you say "昨日、彼が電話をかけてきた," it is clear that he called the speaker. You don't need to say "昨日、彼が '私に' 電話をかけてきた." 
When the object person is omitted and てきた is used, it means that the object person of the action is the speaker.


In all of the following sentences, you don't need to say 私に or 私を.

電車の中で、知らない人が (私に) 話しかけてきた。
A stranger spoke to me on a train.

いきなり彼が、(私を) 殴ってきた.
He suddenly hit me.
