The Difference Between 〜ない and 〜はない

美味しくない means "not good." Although 美味しくはない also means "not good," it implies that it's acceptable for some reason.

あの店の料理は美味しくないから、あの店には行かない。
- I don't go to that restaurant because the dishes there aren't good.

あの店の料理は美味しくはないけど、安いから時々行く。
- The dishes in that restaurant aren't good, but I sometimes go there because they are not expensive.

By just saying ”あの店の料理は美味しくはない," the listener would understand that there is some point which makes up for its shortcomings.
