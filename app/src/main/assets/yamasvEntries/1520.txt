Using 方(ほう)

方 is used when you are comparing several, usually two, things. When it follows a noun, particle の is used between them. I think writing in hiragana is more common than writing in kanji.

フランス語より日本語のほうがむずかしいと思う。
- I think Japanese is more difficult than French.

iPhoneよりソニーのエクスペリアのほうが安かったので、エクスペリアを買った。
- I bought a Sony Experia because it was cheaper than an iPhone.

It can also follow a verb. You can use both the dictionary form of the verb or the ta-form. There is no difference between them.

バスに乗るより歩くほうが早い。
バスに乗るより歩いたほうが早い。
- It will be quicker to walk than to take a bus.
(You can't use the ta-form for the first verb before より.)

京都では西洋風のホテルより日本風の旅館に泊まるほうがいい。
京都では西洋風のホテルより日本風の旅館に泊まったほうがいい。
- Maybe you should stay at a Japanese style inn rather than a western style hotel in Kyoto.
You can also say 京都では西洋風のホテル "に泊まる" より日本風の旅館に泊まるほうがいい, but it sounds a little redundant because the same verb is repeated.


It can also follow an adjective. 

赤いほうをください。
- [In a shop:] I'll get the red one.
This sentence implies there are a red one and another color one.

冬は(暖かいより)寒いほうが好きだ。
- I like a shivery day rather than warm one in winter.


方 is also used to refer to a direction.

左の方に東京タワーが見えます。
- You can see Tokyo Tower on your left hand side.

アメリカの方から来ました。
- I'm from America.
This is the same as アメリカから来ました, but many people say ～の方から来ました in a situation you don't have to say the exact area, such as Cortland, New York.

東京タワーの方に行きます。
This sentence is ambiguous. You don't know whether the speaker is going to Tokyo Tower or somewhere near it.


方 is also pronounced as かた to refer to a person. It sounds more formal than 人. 

あの赤いシャツを着た方はどなたですか?
- Who is that gentleman wearing a red shirt.

この方はこのレストランのオーナーです。
- This is the owner of this restaurant.

質問のある方はいませんか?
- Does anyone have any questions?

方々(かたがた) is the plural form of かた.

ソニーの役員の方々と打ち合わせをする予定だ。
- I'm having a meeting with board members of Sony.

たくさんの海外の方々が私達の国を訪れます。
- A lot of people from overseas visit our country.
