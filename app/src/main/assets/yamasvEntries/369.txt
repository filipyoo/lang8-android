Japanese Interrogative

The Usages of Japanese interrogatives are sometimes different from that of English.

何で(なんで) is a casual expression and used to mean both "why" and "how." 
"なんでそこに行くの?" can be read as both "Why will you go there?" and "How will you go there?" "なんでそこに行くの(How will you go there)?" is usually used when the speaker asks the means of transport; the speaker expects a simple  answer: "車で(by car),"  "電車で(by train)" or something like that. When the speaker wants to know the detail route to go there, he would say "どうやってそこに行くの?"
You can avoid this ambiguity by pronouncing "なにで" to mean "how" in this case, but many Japanese people pronounce "なんで" for both cases.

"どうやって知ったの?" is a literal translation of "How did you know?" However, most Japanese people say "なんで知ってるの?" to mean that.

We also use "なんで" when we say "What makes you... ?" 
What makes you think so? - なんでそう思うの？
What makes you so beautiful? - なんでそんなにきれいなの？

In the case of "何が," you can't pronounce it なんが. You always have to pronounce it "なにが".
What's the problem? - なにが問題なの?
What's so funny? - なにがそんなにおもしろいの？

どこ is not always used to refer to places. "日本のどこが好きですか" can be read as both "Where do you like in Japan?" and "What do you like about Japan?" Therefore, you can answer "伝統とテクノロジーです(I like Japanese traditions and technologies)" to the Japanese questions.

"彼女のどこが好きなの?" means "What do you like about her?" "彼女の何が好きなの?" sounds unnatural.
