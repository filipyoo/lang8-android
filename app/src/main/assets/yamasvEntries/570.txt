How to say "Could you excuse us?" in Japanese


If you are with several persons and want to talk alone with one of them, you can say "二人きりにしてくれる?" or "席を外してくれる?"  to other persons. 

"席を外す(せきをはずす)" means "to leave one's seat." If someone is looking for a person and you know he/she is in the office, but isn't around there, you can say "彼/彼女は、席を外しています." It's a very common expression; "彼/彼女は、いません" sounds a little childish in formal situations.
