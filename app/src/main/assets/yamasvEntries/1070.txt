Using ままならない

ままならない is used when you can't do something as you want.

人生はままならない。
- You can't live your life as you wish.


It's often used when you can't even do something easy. It's used with particle も in this case.

先週足を骨折して、今は歩くこともままならない。
- I broke my leg last week, and can't even walk now.

東京と違って、この町では車を持ってないと買い物もままならない。
- Unlike in Tokyo, you can't even go shopping if you don't have a car in this town.

日本の新聞は読める？
まさか、僕はひらがなもままならないよ。
- Are you able to read a Japanese newspaper?
- No way! I can't even read hiragana.
(ひらがなもままならない is a short version of ひらがなを読むのもままならない. You can omit an action like this if it's clear in a context.)
