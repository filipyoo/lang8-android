みたい / らしい

I will explain about みたい and らしい.

There is a major difference between みたい and らしい.
You can use みたい when you are talking about your impression or guess.
The other hand, you cannot describe your own judgment or knowledge by using らしい.
らしい is used when you are talking about which you heard from someone. 

彼は映画スターみたい - He looks like a movie star (, but I am not sure he is a movie star.)
彼は映画スターらしい - I don't know about him but I heard that he is a movie star.

試験にパスしたみたい - I think he passed the exam, because he looks happy.
試験にパスしたらしい - Newspaper says that he passed the exam.

私は病気みたい - I feel I'm sick.
私は病気らしい - I don't feel I am sick, but the doctor says I am sick.

私の誕生日は今日らしい - It's sounds strange because you must know your own birthday.

っぽい is a frank expression of みたい. You can replace みたい with っぽい like this. 
Furthermore, っぽい has a nuance of らしい.
Therefore, when you use っぽい, we can't judge whether what you said is a fact or just your guess.

彼は映画スターっぽい
試験にパスしたっぽい
私は病気っぽい
