How to Say Rude Expression Politely


1. お引き取りください
When you want someone to get out of your house, you can say "お引き取りください" to say "Get out" politely. If someone says it to you, you should know that they don't want you to stay any more.

2. お言葉ですが
"お言葉ですが" means "with all due respect." It's used when you take objection to the opinion of someone who you have to show respect, your boss or your client for example. 

お言葉ですが、それはいい方法だとは思いません。
- With all due respect, I don't think it's a good idea.

3. 苦手
苦手 mainly means "to be not good at," but you can also use it to mean "hate" implicitly. If someone gives you a chocolate, but you don't like sweets, "ごめん、甘いものは嫌いだから" sounds a little rude. "ごめん、甘いものは苦手だから" doesn't sound rude. 

4. 間に合ってます
When a salesperson tries to sell you something you don't want to buy,  you can say "間に合ってます." It is an implicit expression of "いりません (I don't want it.)"
