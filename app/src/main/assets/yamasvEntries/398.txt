Usage of 失礼します

失礼します is a polite expression to mean "Excuse me." 

It is also used when you enter someone's house or room. Especially, you should say it when you enter your client's office. You can say おじゃまします instead of it when you enter your friends' or relatives' house. 

You can also say it when you leave the house or room. You can also say 失礼しました in this case. おじゃましました is a little casual version of it.

失礼します is also used to say "good bye," but you can't say 失礼しました to mean "good bye."

失礼しました is also used to mean "I'm sorry." It's okay to say it when you made a little mistake, for example, when you made a wrong correction because of your misunderstanding. However, you shouldn't say it when you made a fatal mistake. You should say "申し訳ありません" or "すみませんでした" in the latter case.



(I used "also" many times in this article. Is there any techniques to avoid it?)
