Issuing Orders Using こと

You can use こと when you issue an order or recommend something by ending the sentence with こと. 

こと comes after u-form of verbs.

こと can also come after a negative form.

Order form using こと is mainly used for permanent orders. It's unnatural to use for a one-time-only order.

x 窓を閉めること。
o 窓を閉めて。

When こと comes after a noun which means actions, you have to use のこと. It's often used in signage.

Seatbelts must be worn.

Don't forget to bring your passport.



In case of the recommendations, です or だ often comes after こと.
