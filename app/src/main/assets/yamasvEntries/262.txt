The Negative and Positive Form Using は

When は comes after a noun which means "entire; every" and は is followed by a negative form, it means a partial negation.

プールに毎日 は 行っていません。
I don't go to a pool every day. 
This sentence implies that the speaker often goes to a pool.

それらの本をまだ全部 は 読んでいません。
I haven't read all of those books yet.
This sentence implies that the speaker has read many of them and is going to read the rest of them.

は can come after a verb.
プールに毎日行って は いません。
それらの本を全部読んで は いません。

When a positive form comes after a noun which means "entire; every," you can't use は.
x プールに毎日 は 行ってます
x その本を全部 は 読みました
o プールに毎日行ってます - I go to a pool every day.
o その本を全部読みました - I've read all of the books.

"プールに毎日行って は います" is correct but it has the different nuance with "プールに毎日行っています." "プールに毎日行ってはいます" has the nuance that "I go to a pool every day, but I can't swim well yet," "I go to a pool every day because it's my parent's order, but I actually don't want to go" or so on.

"それらの本を全部読み は しました" is correct but it has the different nuance with "それらの本を全部読みました." "それらの本を全部読み は しました" has the nuance that "I've read all of those books, but many of them were boring," "I've read all of those books, but I didn't understand well" or so on.
"それらの本を全部読み は しました。おもしろかったです。" sounds unnatural. If you start the sentence with "それらの本を全部読み は しました," the listener expects that a negative phrase will follow it.
