The Usage of "〜だけは〜くない"

"あなたとは結婚したくない" means "I don't want to marry you." "あなたとだけは結婚したくない" means "You are the last person I want to marry." 

生の魚だけは食べたくない。
Raw fishes are the last food I want to eat.

東京にだけは住みたくない。人が多すぎるし、物価が高過ぎる。
Tokyo is the last place I want to live; too many people and too expensive.

歯医者にだけは行きたくない。
A dental office is the last place I want to be.

彼はわがまますぎるので、彼とだけは働きたくない。
He is the last person I want to work with because he is too selfish.


Be careful. The Japanese term "最後" have a positive nuance. Therefore, "あなたは私が一緒に働きたい最後の人です" could have the opposite meaning. It could mean that "My biggest dream is to work with you."
