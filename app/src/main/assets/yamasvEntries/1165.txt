肩を落とす can be used when someone else failed something and you are disappointed like this situation, and also used when you failed something. However, 下を向く is used only when you, not someone else, failed something.

上を向く means to think positively. It's often used to encourage someone who failed something and are depressed.
Of course, 上を向く/下を向く can be also used to mean to look up/down.
