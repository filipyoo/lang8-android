Using 上の子/下の子

If you have two kids, you can refer to the older one as "上の子" and the younger one as "下の子."

私には子供が二人います。上の子は男の子で、下の子は女の子です。
- I have two kids; the older one is a boy and the younger one is a girl.

If you have three kids, you can refer to the second oldest one as "真ん中の子."

彼には3人子供がいて、一番上と一番下は医者で、真ん中の子は弁護士です。
- He has three kids; the oldest one and the youngest one are doctors and the second oldest one is a lawyer.

You can also refer to them as 一番目, 二番目 and 三番目の子:
彼には3人子供がいて、一番目と三番目の子は医者で、二番目の子は弁護士です。
However, 一番上の子,真ん中の子 and 一番下の子 are rather common.

In Japan, the order of the birth is important, even if you are twins; the one who was born earlier is called as 兄/姉, and the other is called as 弟/妹.

彼は私の兄弟です。- He's my brother.
This Japanese sentence sounds weird; you should clarify whether he's your older brother or younger one.
