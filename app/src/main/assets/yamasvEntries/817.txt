Using 人

人 can be used to mean "other people," not to distinguish human beings with other animals or things.

The "人" in each of the following sentences is exactly the same as "他の人."

彼は人のいうことを聞かない。
He never listens to other people.

人の車を勝手に使わないで!
Don't use my car without asking!
(This "人の車" means "a car that is not yours.")

人の顔をじろじろ見るものじゃない。
Don't stare at others.  

人がどう言おうと私はあなたに賛成だ。
I agree with you no matter what other people say.
