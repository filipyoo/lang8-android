わたしのこと

I received a question from my friend.
I think that was very interesting. Therefore I will share that with you.

The question was about the difference between "わたしがわかる" and "わたしのことがわかる."

"わたしがわかる" means "you can recognize me (by my face)" or "you know who I am.".
"わたしのことがわかる" means "you know my personalities or mentalities" or "you know my true self."

You may say "あなたは、わたしのことがわかっていない" to your spouse, even if you were married three decades ago.
If you say "あなたは、わたしがわからない" to your spouse, it means "you lost your memories (by accident,) so you don't know who I am."
