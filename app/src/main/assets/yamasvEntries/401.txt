そこまで言う? / そこまでする?

"そこまで言う?" is used when what someone said is out of line or sounds over the top.  For example, if your boss said to you that "You are an incompetent. Everyone would feel happy if you left this company" when you made a little mistake, you can say "そこまで言いますか?" or "そこまで言う必要ないでしょう?"

"そこまでする?" is used when someone overdo/overkill. If the boss fired you because of the little mistake and announced it on Facebook, everyone would say "そこまでする?"
