Using 自分

自分 is a slightly confusing word. It can be used both to refer yourself and to refer the listener.

このドレス、自分で作ったの。
自分で作ったの? すごい！
- I made this dress myself.
- You did it yourself? Great!

靴を脱がせてくれる？
自分でしなさい！
- Can you take my shoes off?
- Do it yourself!

ありがとう。でも、自分でできる。
- Thank you, but I can do it myself.

君はわがまますぎる。
自分はどうなの？
- You are too selfish!
- What about yourself? / You too!


It's also used to refer the third person you are talking about.

彼が君のことをわがままだって言ってた。
信じられない。自分はどうなの？
- He said that you were too selfish!
- I can't believe that. What about himself?


- She said that she made the dress herself.
彼女は自分であのドレスを作ったって言ってた。
