Using ～はどうですか？

"～はどうですか?" is used to recommend something.

とても日本的なところに行ってみたい。
京都はどうですか？
- I'd like to visit somewhere very Japanese.
- How about Kyoto?

どの車を買えばいいかわからない。
プリウスはどうですか？環境にやさしいですよ。
- I don't know which car I should buy.
- How about Prius. It's ecological.


It's also used to ask the listener's impression of something. Therefore, you can also say "京都はどうですか？" to ask someone who visit to or live in Kyoto about how they feel about there, or "プリウスはどうですか?" to ask someone who has a Prius about how they feel about the car. In this case, it's an ambiguous question; they use this expression just as a conversation starter, so you don't need to answer seriously.


In a casual conversation, you can simply say "～はどう?" in both cases.

お腹すいた。この辺にいいレストランはある？
ラーメンはどう？すぐそこに有名なラーメン屋があるよ。
- I'm hungry. Do you know a good restaurant around hear?
- How about ramen? There is a famous ramen restaurant just around the corner.

この前教えてもらったラーメン屋でお昼を食べてきた。
ラーメンはどうだった？
- I went to the ramen restaurant you told me for lunch.
- What did you think about the ramen?
