日本語が上達してきた

Do you know what does きた in this sentence means? Who came?  Where they came from? Where they came to? 

The きた means 'in progress' not 'came'.  

Therefore when you translate this sentence into English, "My Japanese is improving" is better than "My Japanese has improved."
Since the きた does not mean "came", you can't write "上達して来た". You have to write "上達してきた."


All きた in the following means "in progress."

雨が降ってきた
寒くなってきた
帰りたくなってきた
