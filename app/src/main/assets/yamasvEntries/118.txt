まで/までに, 間/間に, 中/中に, and 明けに.　

まで / までに.
まで means “until,” and までに means “by.”  Therefore, “月曜日までレポートを書かないといけない” means “I have to write the report every day until Monday. If you want to say “I have to finish the report by Monday,” you have to say “月曜日まで’に’ レポートを書かないといけない.”

間(あいだ) / 間に.
Similarly, あいだ means “from the first day until the last day,” and あいだに means “by the last day.” 
夏休みの間、テニスをしたい。
I want to play tennis every day during summer vacation.
夏休みの間に、テニスをしたい。
I want to play tennis some day in summer vacation.

中(ちゅう) / 中に.
The difference between 中 and 中に is the same as that between 間 and 間に. You don’t need to put の before 中.
夏休み中、 テニスをしたい =  夏休みの間、テニスをしたい。
夏休み中に、 テニスをしたい =  夏休みの間に、テニスをしたい。

〜明けに
It’s a common Japanese expression meaning “after 〜.”
休み明けに means “at the first or second day after the holidays.”
週明けに means “at Monday.”
年明けに means “at the beginning of January (or after the winter holidays.”) 
We rarely say 月明けに, because we don’t pay much attention to begin/end of the month.
We often use 明ける. 夜が明ける means “morning dawns,” and 梅雨が明ける means “the rainy season is over.”
