How to negate a strong word in Japanese

あの選手は超一流ではない。
This Japanese sentence sounds slightly unnatural. If you want to say "He is a good player, but not the best player," you should say "あの選手は超一流というほどではない." You can use "というほどで は/も ない" or "というわけで は/も ない" to negate strong words.

この料理は最悪というわけではない。
- These dishes aren't good, but I don't say these are terrible.

- The movie was good, but I don't think that it was marvelous.

彼の家は確かに大きいけど、巨大ってほどでもない。
- His house is indeed big, but it would be an overstatement to describe it as "huge."

ちょっと驚いただけ。「驚愕」ってほどでもない。
I was just a little surprised. "Astonished" is overdramatic.
