〜に言わせれば

"私に言わせれば" means "if you ask me." It is used to say your own opinion which may not be agreed by everyone. 

私に言わせれば、日本語はむずかしい言語ではない。
If you ask me, Japanese isn't a difficult language.
 

Similarly, に言わせれば can come after someone else.

彼に言わせれば、日本語はむずかしい言語ではないそうだ。
- According to him. Japanese isn't a difficult language.
This sentence implies that you don't agree with him. If you agree with him, you can't use 彼に言わせれば.

彼に言わせれば、その事件はこうらしい。
- This is his version of the case.
This sentence implies that he doesn't have the same view of other people.

(When you say someone else's opinion, you should add そうだ or らしい at the end of it.)


に言わせると is also often used as the same meaning.

私に言わせると、日本語はむずかしい言語ではない。
彼に言わせると、日本語はむずかしい言語ではないそうだ。
彼に言わせると、その事件はこうらしい。
