Using やけに

やけに means "very." It's similar with とても, but やけに is mainly used when the speaker doesn't know the reason.

彼は日本に行ったことがないのに、やけに日本語がうまい。
- Although he has never been to Japan, his Japanese is very good.
(This Japanese sentence implies that the speaker doesn't know why he can speak Japanese well. If they know the reason, they would say とても.)

今日はやけに暑い。
- It's very hot today.

彼は最近やけに私にやさしい。なにか企んでいるに違いない。
- He is so kind to me lately. He must be up to something.

彼女はやけに楽しそう。なにがあったんだろう。
- She looks very joyful. I wonder what happened to her.
