What You Should Answer When Someone Asks You "何人兄弟ですか?"

You should count yourself in the number when you say "◯人兄弟です." If you have two brothers, you should say "3人兄弟です" or "兄弟が2人います." 
"2人兄弟です" means that you have one brother.

兄弟 basically means brothers, but it also means sisters. Therefore, you can say "3人兄弟です" if you have one brother and one sister.
