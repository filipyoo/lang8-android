Using かかる

When かかる is used with a specific price, it means "to cost."

タクシーで駅まで2000円くらいかかります。
It'll cost about 2,000 yen to the station by taxi.


When かかる is used without a specific price, it sometimes means "it costs some money" or "it's not free," but it often means "it costs a lot of money."

スタイリストに頼むとお金がかかるから、髪は自分で切っている。
I cut my hair myself because it costs some money to have a stylist do it.
I cut my hair myself because it costs a lot of money to have a stylist do it.
(This Japanese sentence is understandable in both ways.)

毎日外で食事するとお金がかかる。
It'll cost a lot of money to eat out every day.

東京に住むとお金がかかる。
It costs a lot of money to live in Tokyo.


When you say 時間がかかる without saying a specific time, it also means "it takes a lot of time."

タクシーで駅まで15分くらいかかります。
It'll take about 15 minutes to the station by taxi.

駅まで歩いて行くのは時間がかかる。
It'll take a lot of time to walk to the station.
