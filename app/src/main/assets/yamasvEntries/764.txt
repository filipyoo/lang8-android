に after a place

You can almost always use に after a place or position when you describe the existence of someone/something. (This is why many Japanese people often use wrong prepositions before a place in English.)

車庫にバイクがある。
There is a motorcycle in the garage.

天井にクモがいる。
There is a spider on the ceiling.

彼はそのレストランにいる。
He's in the restaurant.

誰かが角に立っている。
Someone is standing at the corner.
(This 立つ is used to describe the existence of someone rather than the action.)

彼は今日本にいる。
He is in Japan now.


When you describe a place where some action is took place, で follows the place.

彼は車庫でバイクを修理している。
He is fixing a motorcycle in the garage.

彼は毎日そのレストランで昼食を食べる。
He eats lunch at the restaurant every day.

誰かが角で叫んでいる。
Someone is yelling at the corner.

彼は今日本で働いている。
He works in Japan now.


When you say 生まれた, both に and で can follow a place. However, it could change the meaning. When you say 彼は農家で生まれた, it means that he was born at a farmhouse. It doesn't tell you that whether his family was a farmer or not. It's possible that he was born when his mother happened to visit the farmhouse. On the other hand, 彼は農家に生まれた means his family was a farmer. It doesn't tell you at where he was actually born; he might be born at a hospital.

彼は金持ちの家に生まれた。
He was born in a rich family.

彼は金持ちの家で生まれた。
He was born at a rich's house.


When you say 彼は日本で生まれた, it just describes where he was born. 彼は日本に生まれた might imply that he was influenced by the Japanese culture or the Japanese people's way of thinking because に生まれた is a expression that focuses the background.
