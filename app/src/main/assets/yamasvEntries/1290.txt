Using ばかり after a Verb

When ばかり follows the ta-form of a verb, it means "have just finished the action."

東京についたばかりです。
- I've just arrived Tokyo.

日本語の勉強を始めたばかりで、ひらがなしか読めません。
- I've just started learning Japanese; I can't read Japanese characters except hiragana.

このジュースは採れたばかりの果物で作っているからとても新鮮だ。
- This juice is very flesh because it's made from fruit just harvested.



When ばかり follows the dictionary form of a verb, it means "do nothing but the action.

何を聞いても彼女は泣くばかりだ。
- No matter what I ask her, she does nothing but crying.

You can't use ta-form in this case even if you are talking about the past. The past form of this sentence is "何を聞いても彼女は泣くばかりだった." 
If you say "彼女は泣いたばかりだった," it means "she had just stopped crying."

何度も試したけれど、「パスワードが違っています」というメッセージが出るばかりだった。
- I tried again and again, but it only said "Your password is incorrect."


Similarly, it can follow the te-form of verbs and the form of the verb before it doesn't change even if you are talking about the past.

彼はマンガを読んでばかりいる。
- He's always reading manga.

子供の頃、マンガを読んでばかりいた。
- When I was a child, I was always reading manga.
