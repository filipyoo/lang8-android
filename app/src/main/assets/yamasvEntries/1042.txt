Using てっきり

"てっきり〜と(ばかり)思ってた" means "I was sure 〜" or "I assumed 〜." It's used when what you believed was wrong.

てっきりソニーはアメリカの会社だと(ばかり)思っていた。
- I was sure that Sony is an American company.

てっきり日本人は毎日寿司を食べてると(ばかり)思ってた。
- I assumed that Japanese people eat sushi every day.


Since てっきり itself implies 思ってた, you can omit 思ってた in a conversation.

彼はどこ？
てっきりあなたといっしょかと。
- Where is he?
- I assumed he was with you.

私を日本人だと思ってた？
てっきり。
- Did you believe I was Japanese?
- Yes, I did.
