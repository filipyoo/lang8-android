だから言ったでしょ

"だから言ったでしょ" is a very popular phrase to mean "I told you!" It is used when someone had ignored your advice or warnings and he had trouble.

For example, if your son had ignored your advice to bring an umbrella and he was soaked to the skin, you can say "だから言ったでしょ." You don't need to say "だから傘を持って行きなさいと言ったでしょ," "だから言ったでしょ" has the exact same nuance.

"だから言ったのに" and "だから言っただろ" also have the same nuance. ("だろ" is used by men instead of "でしょ".)

If you gave warnings many times before he had trouble, you can say "だからあれほど言ったでしょ."
