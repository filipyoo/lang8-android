Japanese Causative-passive Form

Japanese causative-passive form is mainly used in negative sentences. For example, 食べさせられた is mainly used when someone served you terrible foods or someone forced you to eat something you hate.

彼女にひどい料理を食べさせられた - She served me terrible dishes.
You should say "おいしい料理を 食べ'させてもらった'" If the dishes were delicious and you thank her.

上司の引っ越しを手伝わさせられた
This Japanese sentence means that the speaker helped their boss's moving, and implies that the speaker didn't want to. 

彼女に誕生日ブレゼントとして高い靴を買わされた。
- My girlfriend made me buy expensive shoes as her birthday present.
This Japanese sentence also implies that the speaker has a complaint about the fact. He would say "買ってあげた" if he bought an expensive present with pleasure.

いつもくだらないジョークを聞かされるから、ボスが嫌い。
- I don't like my boss because he always tells me stupid jokes.

彼に嘘をつかされた
- He forced me to lie. (I had to lie against my will.)
