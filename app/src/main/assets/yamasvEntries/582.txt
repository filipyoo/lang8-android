Using 思った

"I thought you would like it."
"I knew you would like it."

If I understand correctly, the former English sentence implies that the listener doesn't like it, and the latter implies that the listener does.
However, you can use "思った" in both cases in Japanese. We would add のに after it when the result is different from what we expected. "知ってた" sounds unnatural in the latter case even if you had a confidence about your prediction.

I thought you would like it. - 気に入ると思ったのに。
I knew you would like it. - 気に入ると思った。

I thought you would pass the exam. - あなたは試験に受かると思ってたのに。
I knew you could pass the exam.  - あなたは試験に受かると思ってた。

I knew it! - やっぱり、そうだと思った!
