Adjectives which represent colors in Japanese.

赤い、青い、白い、黒い. -  Red, blue, white and black.
These words are adjectives which represent colors; after these words an い is added after the nouns that represent each color.
The other colors don't follow this rule. You can't say 緑い, 茶い, 黃い, etc.
You have to say them like this: 
緑色の, 茶色の、黄色の etc. - Green, gray, yellow, etc.

Why?

In the ancient times of Japan, we recognized only four colors: red (赤), blue(青), white(白), and black(黒). You can add い directly to these nouns when you use these words as adjectives.
All the rest of the colors were founded after those days. You cannot add い directly after them to modify nouns.

You can say 〜色の for all colors, but it's more natural to say 赤い, 青い, 白い and 黒い for these four colors.

You can say 〜色い for some colors:
黄色い, 茶色い etc.
