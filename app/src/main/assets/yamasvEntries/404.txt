一生（いっしょう）

You can use 一生 as two meanings: "entire life (from birth until death)" and "rest of your life."


一生あなたを愛します。
I promise to love you rest of my life.

お前は一生刑務所で過ごすことになるだろう。
You'll spend the rest of your life in  jail.

彼女は一生独身でした。
She was single her entire life.


死ぬまで is also a common expression to mean 一生.

死ぬまでこのことは誰にも言いません。
I won't say this until the day I die.

彼は死ぬまで一度も海を見ることはなかった。
He had never seen the sea in his life.


”一生のお願い" is a popular phrase when you ask favors desperately. 

一生のお願いだから、お金を貸して。
This is the last thing I'll ever ask of you. Please lend me some money.
(Of course, if you often used "一生のお願い," you would lose your trust.)
