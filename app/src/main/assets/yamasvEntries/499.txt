Particle は in a Negative Form

When you describe what you see, you should use が after the subject.

桜 が 咲いています - Cherry blossoms are blooming.

(は after the subject is used when you describe general characteristics.
桜は毎年４月に咲きます - Every year, cherry blossoms bloom in April.)

However, when you want to say "Cherry blossoms don't bloom yet," you should use は: 桜はまだ咲いていません.
(が in a negative form sounds as if you stress the subject. "桜がまだ咲いていません" sounds as if you imply that all other flowers, which are expected to bloom, are blooming.)

公園に犬 が います - There is a dog in this park. 
公園に犬 は いません - There is no dog in this park.

彼 が 今朝あなたに会いに来ました - He came to see you this morning.
彼 は 来ていません - He didn't come.


を after the object also sometimes changes into は in negative forms.
犬を飼っています - I have a dog.
犬は飼ってません - I don't have a dog. (犬を飼ってません isn't incorrect, but は sounds more natural for me.)

車を貸します - I can lend you my car.
車は貸しません - I can't lend you my car.


に/と after the object also sometimes changes into には/とは in negative forms.

次の日本旅行の時、京都 に 行きます - I will visit Kyoto during next trip to Japan.
次の日本旅行の時、京都 には 行きません - I won't visit Kyoto during next trip to Japan.

彼 と 遊びたい - I want to play with him.
彼 とは 遊びたくない - I don't want to play with him.
