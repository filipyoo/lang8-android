The Difference Between だけ and ばかり

My friend on Lang-8 asked me to explain the difference between them. I'll try.

だけ is a strict expression. If there is an exception, you can't use だけ. 彼は寿司だけ食べます means that he eats only sushi and never eat other foods. If he eats sushi two or more times a week. You should say 彼は寿司ばかり食べます. (Some of you may think that Japanese people often eat sushi, but most of us eat it only once or twice a month. I like sushi, but I don't remember the last time I ate it.)

その店にいるのは観光客だけです means that there is no single person that isn't a tourist in the shop. You should say 観光客ばかり if many of the customers are tourists.

私はゲームばかりしています means "I often play video games in my free time" rather than "I play video games all night and all day."
