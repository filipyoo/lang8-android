Using 〜だけ〜てみる

When the same verbs are placed before and after だけ, it means that "I don't think the action will bring a good result, but I'll try it anyway." The dictionary form of the verb is placed before だけ and the te-form of the verb follows it.

The phrases in parentheses in each following sentence would be omitted because they are implied by the expressions which follow them.

（知ってるとは思えないけど、）彼に聞くだけ聞いてみる。
- (I don't think he knows it, but) I'll ask him anyway.

（あの店にそれが売っているかわからないけど）行くだけ行ってみる。
- (I'm not sure that it's sold in that shop, but) I'll go there to buy it anyway.
 
（この薬が効くとは思えないけど）飲むだけ飲んでみる。
- (I don't think that this medicine will work, but) I'll try it anyway.

（彼が私の言うことを聞くとは思えないけど）たばこを止めるように言うだけ言ってみる。
- (I don't think he'll take my advice, but) I'll try to persuade him to stop smoking anyway.

（その試験はむずかしくて合格するとは思えないけど、）受けるだけ受けてみる。
- (I know the exam is very difficult and I don't think that I can pass it, but) I'll take it anyway. 


やるだけやってみたら？
- Why don't you try it? 
This Japanese sentence implies that the speaker doesn't think that it will work. However, they think that it's worth to try because you won't lose anything even if you fail.
