はい Doesn't Always Mean "Yes," And いいえ Doesn't Always Mean "No"

To answer for a yes-no question in Japanese is sometimes difficult because はい doesn't always mean "yes." はい means "you are right."

あなたはアメリカ人ですね? - You are American, right?
はい。
Technically, this answer, "はい", isn't the same as "Yes, I am"; it means "You are right." Therefore, if they ask you with a negative form like "あなたはアメリカ人じゃないですよね?," "You are not an American, right?" in English, you need to answer "いいえ" if you are an American; this いいえ means "you are wrong."
When you answer a yes-no question, you have to choose はい/いいえ according whether what they said is correct or not. Therefore, when they ask with a negative form, the answer はい/いいえ is not the same as yes/no.


あなたはアメリカ人ですね? - You are an American, right?
はい。アメリカ人です。- You are right. I'm an American.
いいえ。アメリカ人じゃないです。- You are wrong. I'm not an American.

あなたはアメリカ人じゃないですよね? - You are not an American, right?
はい、アメリカ人じゃないです。- You are right. I'm not an American.
いいえ、アメリカ人です。- You are wrong. I'm an American.

私のチョコレート食べたでしょ? - You ate my chocolate, right?
はい、食べました。- You are right. I did.
いいえ、食べてません - You are wrong. I did not.

私のチョコレート食べてないよね? - You didn't eat my chocolate, right?
はい、食べてません。- You are right. I did not.
いいえ、食べました。- You are wrong. I did.


あなたはアメリカの大統領じゃないですよね?
- You are not the president of America, are you?
Only Obama can say "いいえ" for this question.
