Complex Japanese Rule in Q&amp;A

I will introduce a complex Japanese rule when you ask something and answer it.

When we ask you "Do you have a pen?" , we say "ペンを持ってますか?" or "ペンを持ってませんか?" 

持ってます and 持ってません are completely opposite. However, "ペンを持ってますか?" and "ペンを持ってませんか?" are exactly the same meaning. We don't use them consciously.

If you are asked "ペンを持ってますか?"  You will answer "はい、持ってます" or "いいえ、持ってません" 

If you are asked "ペンを持ってませんか?"  You have to  answer "はい、持ってません" or "いいえ、持ってます" 

The answer depends on how you were asked, not whether you have a pen or not. 
( I know this rule is different from English method.)


Then, if your friend says "いいです"  after you ask him "コーヒーを飲みますか?" What he wanted to say is "No, thank you".  If he says "いいですね", what he wanted to say is "Sounds good!" 


The next one is more complex.
If someone says "いいです" after you ask him "部屋を掃除してもいいですか?" .  He might say "(しなくても)いいです" or  "(しても)いいです".
You have to judge his will from his expression and tone. 

Finally:
If you want to work in Japan as a businessman, you have to learn the meaning of "前向きに検討します."  When you translate with google , it says "We will actively examine that."  However, in most cases when your client said that, it means "No, thank you, We won't examine it at all."



If you know another complex rule or expression, please tell me.
