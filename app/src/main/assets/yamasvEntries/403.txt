見る / 見られる

Many Japanese verbs have the same potential form and passive form.
見られる is the potential form and also is the passive form of 見る.

This is an example sentence of the potential form.
このビルの屋上から富士山が見られる。(見える also sounds natural in this sentence.)
- You can see Mt Fuji from the rooftop of this building.

This is an example of the passive form.
弟に日記を見られた。
- My brother read my diary today. / My diary is read by my brother today.

"弟に日記を見られた" and "弟が日記を見た" have the same meaning technically, but 見られた has the nuance that you feel bad for his behavior. "足元を見られる" is an idiom which means someone takes advantage of your weakness. 
Similarly, 聞かれた is used when someone hears what you don't want to be known.


見る can also be used to describe your guesses. 見ている and 見られている sound natural in this case.

I think that Brazil will become the champion of next World Cup.

彼は今年中に社長を辞めると見られている。
All people think that he'll resign the president by the end of this year.
