"いい加減" has Several Meanings.

(a) "この作品はいい加減だ" 
Most Japanese think that this means "This works is sloppy, I hate it."
When you use "いい加減" as an adjective, it means irresponsible/halfhearted/random/vague/groundless.


However, you can understand (a) as "This works has a good controlled balance." 
In this case, "いい加減" means "良い + 加減", good balance. When you use "いい加減" in this meaning in conversation, you have to emphasize "いい", and pause a moment between "いい" and "加減."
I think this is a reasonable usage because "いい" means "good" and "加減" means "control", but this usage is rarely used.  Since "いい加減" is often understood as the meaning of (a), you had better use "いい頃合い/いい塩梅(あんばい)" instead of this. (The Japanese must be surprised if you use "いい塩梅", because it is a very deep expression.)


If your boss always said same flat joke, you might say "That's enough."  You could say that in Japanse "いい加減にしてよ." 
"いい加減にしなさい!" is a phrase that a mother, who has young children, unconsciously uses repeatedly.
