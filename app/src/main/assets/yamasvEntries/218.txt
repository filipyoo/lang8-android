The Usage of 〜と思う

〜と思う is only used to describe the speaker's thought. You can't use this expression to describe the other's thought.

o 私は来年日本に行こうと思う - I think I will go to Japan next year.
x 彼は来年日本に行こうと思う。

You have to use 思っている when you describe the other's thought.

O 彼は来年日本に行こうと思っている - He thinks that he will go to Japan next year.


"彼は来年日本に行くと思う" means "I think he will go to Japan next year," because 思う is only used to describe the speaker's thought.

"彼は来年日本に行くと思っている" is ambiguous. You can read this sentence as "I am thinking that he will go to Japan next year" and "He thinks that he will go to Japan next year."
