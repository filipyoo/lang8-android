The difference between たいてい and よく.

たいてい and よく are similar words, but there is a major difference between them. たいてい means "almost all/every," and よく is an expression based on the speaker's subjective view.
If you say "朝、たいていヨーグルトを食べます," we think that you eat yogurt almost every morning. On the other hand, if you say "朝、よくヨーグルトを食べます," we can't guess how often you eat it in the morning. It may be almost every morning, it may be three days a week. You can say "朝、よくヨーグルトを食べます" even if you eat it one day a week if you think other people rarely eat it in the morning.


By the way, I don't know the detailed nuance of "often." What do you think if I say "I often eat yogurt in the morning?"
