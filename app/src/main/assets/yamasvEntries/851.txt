Using 一時

1時 means "one o'clock."

決勝戦は1時に始まる。
- The final match is supposed to start at one o'clock.

When you write it using kanji, "一時," it also means "for a while" or "temporarily."

試合は雨で一時中断された。
- The match was suspended temporarily because of the rain.

彼はその事故のあと、一時意識を失った。
- He lost consciousness for a while after the accident.


一時 is usually used for a short period of time, such as for a few minutes or hours. If you refer to a long period of time, such as for a few months or years, 一時期 sounds more natural.

私は一時期東京に住んでいた。
- I had lived in Tokyo for a while.

私は一時期タクシーの運転手をしていた。
- I had worked as a taxi driver for a period.

Of course, it sounds unnatural to use it with a specific period of time.
x 私は一時期、3年間東京に住んでいた (Sounds unnatural.)
