Using よろしく

よろしく or よろしくお願いします is often used in Japanese conversations. It's used to mean "Nice to meet you" when you meet a person for the first time, or to mean "Thank you" when you ask someone to do something. よろしく has no special meaning in most cases, so you don't need to consider it. Most Japanese people use it without thinking deeply.

初めまして。よろしくお願いします。
- Nice to meet you.

この文を英語に翻訳してくれませんか？ よろしくお願いします。
- Can you translate this sentence into English for me? Thank you.
(In this sentence, よろしく sounds more natural than ありがとう. We rarely say ありがとう before you do the favor.)



When よろしく follows a noun, it means "like ～." It's mainly used when you imitate someone you admire.

- My five-year-old son blew a kiss to me like a professional soccer player after he scored a goal.

ママがファッションモデルよろしく鏡の前でポーズをとっている。笑いが止まらない。
- My mom is posing like a fashion model in front of a mirror. I can't stop laughing.
