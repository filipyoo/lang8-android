Using やっと

やっと is an adverb that means "finally." When you say "やっと終わった," it implies the object was boring or hard.

彼の長いスピーチがやっと終わった。
- Finally, his long speech ended.

宿題がやっと終わった。
- Finally, I've finished my homework.


It's also used to describe what you barely can do. In this case, it appears at the end of the sentence as a predicate.

日本の新聞は読めますか？
まさか。私はひらがながやっとです。
- Are you able to read Japanese newspaper?
- No way. I can just barely read hiragana.

日本語は話せますか?
簡単な挨拶がやっとです。
- Do you speak Japanese?
- I can just barely speak simple greetings.

何回腕立て伏せできる?
3,4回がやっと。
- How many times can you push-up?
- Only three or four.

日本刀を作るのにはすごく時間がかかります。熟練した職人でさえ、1ヶ月に2本がやっとです。
- It takes a long time to make Japanese sword. Even experienced craftsman can make only two in one month.
(It's just an example sentence. I don't know how long it takes.)
