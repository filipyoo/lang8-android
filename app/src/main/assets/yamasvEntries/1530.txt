Using 行く and 来る

行く means "to go," and 来る means "to come," but the usage is a little difference from that in English.
When you come where the listener is, you can't say 来る; you need to say 行く. You always need to say from your point of view, not from the listener's point of view.

毎朝9時に会社に行きます。

This sentence sounds a little ambiguous. The speaker may be saying that they leave their house at 9 every morning or they arrive at their office at 9. Most Japanese people will understand this Japanese sentence as the former. You should say 会社に着きます when you want to clear that you arrive at your office at specific time.

If you will come where the listener is, 9時に行きます means you'll be there at 9.

いつ家に来るの?
9時に行く。
- When will you come to my house?
- I'll be there at 9.
