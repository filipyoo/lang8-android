Using 悪い to Mean "Thank you"

悪い basically means "bad."

He's a bad guy. - 彼は悪いやつだ。
I'm sorry. It was my fault. ごめん。私が悪かった。

Furthermore, as すみません means both "sorry" and "thank you," 悪い also can be used to mean "thank you."

テーブルを動かすのを手伝ってくれる? - Can you help me to move the table?
いいよ。 - Sure, no problem.
悪いね。- Thank you.

京都に行ってきたの。これはおみやげ。

- Thank you for always.
