The Usage of 〜きり

きり can follow the numbers of person to mean "alone."

一人きりで散歩するのが好きだ。
- I like going for a walk without anybody else.

彼女と二人きりで食事出来たらいいのに。
- I wish I could have a dinner with her alone.

このことを知っているのは、我々３人きりだ。
- Nobody except three of us know that.

It sounds unnatural to use きり with large numbers.


"一度きり" means "only once. " You can't say 二度きり, 三度きり etc.

日本に行ったのは一度きりです。
- I've been to Japan only once.

人生は一度きり。
- You only get one life.


"きり" can follow the ta-form of verbs. It's used to describe that you haven't done the action for a while.

日本には、子供の時に行ったきりです。
I've not been to Japan after I visited there when I was a child.

日本語は、大学の時に授業でとったきりです。
I've not spoken Japanese since I had finished Japanese class in university.

彼女とは、卒業式で会ったきりです。
Our graduation ceremony was the last time I saw her.
(This Japanese sentence means that not only the speaker has not seen her after the ceremony, but also they have not communicated with each other by telephone, e-mail or other tools.)

きり and 以来 are not the same.  "彼女とは、卒業式で会って以来です" also means that you haven't seen her after the ceremony, but it implies that you are seeing her now or you are going to see her soon.
