The Difference Between 美しい and きれい

Both 美しい and きれい means "beautiful." "美しい女性" and ”きれいな女性" or "美しい花" and "きれいな花" have the same meanings. 
However, きれい also can be used to mean "clean." "きれいな街" can be read as both  "beautiful town" and "clean town." 
"部屋をきれいにしておきなさい" can be read as "Keep your room beautifully," but it usually means "Keep your room clean."

きれいに also means "completely."
