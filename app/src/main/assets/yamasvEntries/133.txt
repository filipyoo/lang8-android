今さら

It is used when something is too late.

今さら いくら早く走っても間に合わない。
It's too late to make it on time, no matter how fast you run.

今さら 勉強しても試験には間に合わない。
It's too late to study for the exam.

今さら 後悔しても遅い。
It's too late for regrets now.


You can also use it with non-negative phrases. ながら or だけど will follow 今さら in this case.

今さら ながら、iPhoneを買った。
I know it's too late, but I bought an iPhone.

今さら だけど、最近英語の勉強を始めた。
I know it's too late, but I started studying English lately.


Since 今さら implies "it's too late," it is sometimes used by itself:

「本当にごめんなさい」 - I'm so sorry.
「今さら」 - It's too late to apologize.
(This is a natural Japanese conversation.)

このニュースは今さらの感がある。
This news seems old.
