Using 馬鹿

馬鹿 means "idiot/stupid." Of course, you had better not say it to a stranger. However, it's sometimes used with a positive nuance. If you say ”お前馬鹿だな" to your friend with a smile, it implies that "You are a funny guy. I like you." 

馬鹿なことをするな has two meanings: "Don't do such a stupid thing" and "Don't do such a funny thing."

馬鹿 can follow another noun: 野球馬鹿、サッカー馬鹿、英語馬鹿、数学馬鹿, etc. 野球馬鹿 means someone who really loves baseball. It has a positive nuance; it implies they have a passion for baseball and always practice very hard. At the same time, it has a negative nuance; it implies they don't know anything but baseball. Even If someone has a strong passion for baseball, you can't call them 野球馬鹿 if they are also interested in something else.
