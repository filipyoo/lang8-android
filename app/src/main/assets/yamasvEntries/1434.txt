Using 音を上げる

When you pronounce it as おとをあげる, it means to turn a sound up.

It can also be pronounced as ねをあげる, which means to give up something because it's too hard to put up with.

- You'd run away in three days, if you joined the army.

- I started learning French, but I gave it up in a week. It was too difficult for me to understand.
(If you gave it up because you were too busy, you can't say 音を上げる. It's only used when you can't put up with something.)
