懲りない人 means a someone who never learn from a failure and repeat the same failures many times.


懲りずに can be used in a positive sentence.

- He failed many times, but never give up the research and finally discovered new material.

彼は下手な日本語を人に馬鹿にされても、懲りずに日本語で話しかけるのを止めない。だから彼の日本語はどんどん良くなっている。

懲り懲り(こりごり) is a stronger expression than 懲りる. It's used as a predicate to mean that you'll never do something.

スキーで足を折った。スキーは懲り懲りだ。
- I broke my leg while skiing. I'll never ski again.

あの工場で働くのは懲り懲りだ。仕事は退屈だし何も学ぶことがない。
- I don't want to work at that factory again. The job is very boring and you can't learn anything from it.


You can use まっぴら instead in the two sentences above.
スキーはまっぴらだ。
あの工場で働くのはまっぴらだ。
However, they are not completely interchangeable. You can't say 懲り懲りだ when you haven't experienced the object.

東京に住むのは懲り懲りだ。人が多すぎる。
東京に住むのはまっぴらだ。人が多すぎる。
- I don't want to live in Tokyo. There are too many people there.
The first sentence implies that the speaker have lived in Tokyo, but the second one don't tell you whether they have lived there or not. If you say "もうまっぴらだ," it implies they have lived there, so "懲り懲りだ" and " 'もう' まっぴらだ" are interchangeable.
