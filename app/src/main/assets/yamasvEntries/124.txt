〜ておく

ておく is used when you do something for specific purposes. 窓を開けておく means to open a window, and implies you do it for a specific purpose: to refresh air or so on. You brush your teeth every morning without being aware of specific purpose, so “毎朝、歯をみがい ておく” sounds unnatural. If you say “歯をみがいておく,” we feel that you have a specific purpose. We may think that you are going to kiss your girlfriend today for the first time. 
Furthermore, when ておく follows a punctual verb, which is a verb indicating an action that doesn’t have a duration, it implies that something will keep up a certain status for a while. Therefore, “Keep the door open” may be better as a translation of “ドアを開けておいて” than “Open the door.”
