When you say ご飯 to mean rice, it always refers to cooked rice. When you want to refer to uncooked rice, you need to say 米(こめ) or お米. There are some types of rice, so you should say 白米(はくまい) when you want to refer to white rice strictly.


食べる can be used as a metaphor for to live. 食う(くう) is a rude version of it. They are often used as the ていく form in this case.
