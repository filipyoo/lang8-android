Using Past Form to Imply That You Didn't Know Something

東京に住んでいたんですか?
- Do you live in Tokyo? I didn't know that.

This sentence has the same meaning as "東京に住んでいるんですか?" You can also use the past form like this even if the listener lives in Tokyo now to imply that you didn't know the fact. "東京に住んでいたんですか?" is also used to mean "Did you live in Tokyo before?" so you need to judge from the context.

トヨタ車の多くはメキシコで作られていたんだ。(知らなかった。)
- A lot of Toyota are made in Mexico. I didn't know that.
(You can also say 作られている instead of 作られていた.)

彼は先生だったって今日知った。生徒だと思っていた。
- I realized that he's a teacher today. I thought he's a student.
(It slightly sounds more natural than "彼は先生だって今日知った.")

今日は金曜日だった? 土曜日だと思ってた。
- Is it Friday today? I thought it's Saturday.
(You can also say "今日は金曜日?," but it implies that you have no idea what the day today is. The past form implies that you thought that it's another day.)
