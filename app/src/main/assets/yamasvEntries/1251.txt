Every business person in Japan says お世話になってます when they see their clients. It means "I owe you a lot on business" or "You always help my business a lot." However, you can say it to a person you first meet because it's just a common phrase; it doesn't have special meanings.


世話を焼く means "to take good care of someone." It has both good and bad nuance.

彼女は人の世話を焼くのが好きみたいだ。困っている人がいると放っておかない。
- She seems to like taking good care of someone. She never ignores someone in trouble.

- You shouldn't take care of your children too much.


世話が焼ける means to be troublesome.

It's also used for someone who requires much aid of someone else.

- My husband can't do anything without me. He doesn't even know where his socks are.


余計なお世話 or 大きなお世話 means "It's none of your business." They are used when someone told you something rude. You can't omit the お before 世話.
