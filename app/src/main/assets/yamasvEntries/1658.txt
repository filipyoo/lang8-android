たくさんの会社に履歴書を送ったけど、どこも仕事をくれない。
- I sent my resumes to a lot of companies, but none of them offered me a job.


It's also used to mean to give someone a lift.

彼が家まで送ってくれた。
- He gave me a lift home.

毎日子供たちを学校に送っています。
- I drive my kids to school every day.

彼が家まで送ると言ったけど断った。
- He offered me to walk me home, but I declined it.


You need to 行かせる to mean to send someone.

彼をそちらに行かせます。

彼は大事な決定をいつも先送りにする。
- He always puts off making a decision on important issues.

やるべきことを先送りにしてはいけない。
- You shouldn't put off what you should do.
