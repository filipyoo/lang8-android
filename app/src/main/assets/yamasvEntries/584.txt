When you should say 私は

As many of you know, Japanese people don't start a sentence with 私は when they are talking about themselves. It sounds unnatural in many cases. However, there is a case they say it intentionally. It's when they want to show a contrast.

When they introduce themselves, they usually start a sentence with 私は because to introduce yourself is to explain the difference between you and other people.

When you ask a Japanese person who is with a friend whether he/she can speak English or not, if he/she answers "「私は」話せます," it implies that the friend can't. ( Or he/she doesn't know whether the friend can or not.) They wouldn't say 私は if he/she know that the friend can too.

When you ask them "Do you like a rainy day?" They might say "「私は」好きです" if they like it. It's because many people don't like it. On the other hand, if you ask "Do you like a sunny day?" and they like it, they wouldn't say 私は because of the similar reason.
