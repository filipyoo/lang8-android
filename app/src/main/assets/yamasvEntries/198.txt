Double negatives in Japanese.

Japanese people prefer to use double negatives.

The following phases are often used. 
ないわけではない 
言えないこともない / 言えなくはない 
ないこともない / ないことはない 
なくもない / なくはない


可能性が ないわけではない.
The literal translation of this sentence is "It's not true that there is no possibility." The speaker wants to say "I know the possibility is very low, but it doesn't mean the possibility is zero." This implies that he believes the possibility.

彼が悪いと 言えないこともない.
The speaker wants to say "I know everybody think that he is not wrong, but if you ask me, he is wrong."


When you invite your friend to go to a party, he may say "行かないこともない." His answer means "I was not interested in the party till now, but I would go if you really want to go with me."


The following double negative phrases are used to stress your opinion:
ないはずがない / ないわけがない
せずにいられない
なしでは 　〜ない

彼がその試験に合格しないはずがない.
It's impossible for him to fail the exam.
He is sure to pass the exam.

後悔せずにいられない.
I can't help regretting it.

彼なしでは、試合に勝てない。
We can't win the game without him.



窓を閉めないでくれませんか？
This is not a double negative expression. "窓を閉めないでくれませんか？" is the same as "窓を閉めないでください." This means "Please don't close the window." When you ask someone to do something, negative expressions sounds more polite.
