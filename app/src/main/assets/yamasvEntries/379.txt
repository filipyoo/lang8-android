〜を間違えた

When you took a wrong bus, you can say "間違ったバスに乗った." However, "バスを間違えた" is a common expression to mean that. "〜を間違えた" is often used in Japanese. 

"〜を間違えた" is also used when you are unsatisfied with something. "買う本を間違えた" means that "I bought a different book from what I wanted to buy by mistake," but you can also say that when it was a boring book for you. 
"入る会社を間違えた" means that you don't like the company you work for and you are thinking that you should have chosen another company. 
If you are not a Japanese person and you wish you were born in Japan, you can say "生まれてくる国を間違えた." I think that has the same nuance as "I was born in the wrong place" in English, but "間違った国に生まれた" sounds a little bit unnatural. You should say "生まれてくる国を間違えた" in this case.
"結婚する相手を間違えた" is used when you regret the marriage.
