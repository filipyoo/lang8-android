人 and 人たち

As you know, you don't have to be aware of the difference between singular and plural in many cases in Japanese. 
The difference between 人 and 人々/人たち is one of the rare exceptions of that. It's a little bit complicated.
人々 and 人たち means "people", but you can say both "たくさんの人がいる  and "たくさんの 人々/人たち がいる" to mean "there are a lot of people."
Furthermore, "人がたくさんいる" is correct, but "人々 / 人たち がたくさんいる" are incorrect to mean "there are a lot of people.". (It's correct when some expressions which modify 人々 or 人たち are placed before them: "バスを待っている 人たち がたくさんいる."  "バスを待っている 人 がたくさんいる" is also correct. )

You may think that you can always use 人 instead of 人々/人たち, but you can't use 人 when you refer to a specific group of people in question form. "あの人は誰?" implies you refer to a single person. You have to say "あの人たちは誰?" to mean "Who are they?"
Similarly, "あの 人 はどこに行ったの?" implies you refer to a single person. You have to say "あの 人たち はどこに行ったの?" when you refer to a group of people.
