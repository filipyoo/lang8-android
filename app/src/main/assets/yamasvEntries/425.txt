Passive Form in Japanese

先生が私をほめた。
私は先生にほめられた。
The two Japanese sentences above describe the same fact "My teacher praised me." The only difference is that one sentence is written in the passive form, while the other isn't. However, I can say that almost all Japanese people prefer the latter. When we make a sentence which includes a description about ourselves, we choose ourself as the subject of the sentence. Therefore, if you always used the former expression, I'd easily realize that you're not a native Japanese speaker even if you said it with a perfect intonation.

When two persons appear in a sentence, we choose the closer person as the subject.
息子が友達をけった - My son kicked his friend.
息子が友達にけられた - My son was kicked by his friend.
This rule means that you can know that who is the closer person for the speaker by focusing who the speaker choose as the subject. If someone says that "太郎が花子にけられた," it implies the speaker is familiar with 太郎 more than 花子. If the speaker likes 花子 than 太郎, the speaker would say "花子が太郎をけった." When the speaker likes 太郎 as much as 花子, 花子 would be chosen as the subject to avoid using the passive form.
