How to Say "Did you hear that?" in Japanese

"今の聞いた?" sounds natural if the "that" refers to something you heard just now. 

今の(変な音)聞いた?
- Did you hear that (strange noise)?

If you say "あれ聞いた?," it sounds as if you are talking about a rumor or something the listener might hear a few days before.

Similarly, you can say "今の見た?" to mean "Did you see that?" when you are referring to something you saw just now.

今の (おかしな帽子かぶってた男) 見た?
- Did you see that (man wearing a funny hat)?
