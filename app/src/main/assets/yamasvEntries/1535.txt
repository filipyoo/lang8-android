Using 以上

When it follows a number, it means "more than." Technically, it include the number, so 5以上 means "five or more than five." However, it's ambiguous in a conversation.

この車に200万円以上払いたくない。
- I don't want to pay more than two million yen for the car.

10回以上日本に行ったことがある。
- I've visited Japan for more than 10 times.
(Technically, you need to say 11回以上 to mean "more than 10 times," but nobody picks about it in this type of conversation.") 

3期以上大統領を務めることはできない。
- You can't serve as the president for more than two terms.


You can also say 以上 to mean "because/as long as." It follows a phrase in this case and sounds very formal.

彼が上司である以上、好きでも嫌いでも彼に従わないといけない。
- You have to follow him, no matter you like him or not because he's your boss.

機械でない以上、ミスはする。
- You could make a mistake because you're not a machine.

この会社の従業員である以上、会社の利益を第一に考えるべきだ。
- You are supposed to give the first priority to the company's profit as long as you are an employee of this company.
