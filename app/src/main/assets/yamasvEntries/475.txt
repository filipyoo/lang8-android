The Usage of 〜ところだ

1.
When ところだ follows the dictionary form of verbs, it means "be about to."

今から、昼食を食べるところだ。
I'm about to have lunch.

今から、買い物に行くところだ。
I'm about to go shopping.

You can't use "the dictionary forms of verbs + ところだ" after you start the action.


2.
When you are doing the action, you should say "ているところだ."

今、昼食を食べているところだ。
I'm having lunch now.

今、買い物しているところだ。
I'm middle of shopping now.


3.
When ところだ follows the ta-form of verbs, it means that the action has just finished.

今、昼食を食べたところだ。
I've finished lunch just now.

母は、買い物に行ったところだ。
My mother just went shopping.

２日前に彼と話したところだ。(I talked with him two days ago.)
This sentence sounds unnatural if you talk with him almost every day, but it's okay if you rarely talk with him, for example about once a month.
