Love-related Terms and Expressions in Japanese

彼/彼女
Japanese people rarely used personal pronouns in a conversation. 彼 and 彼女 are mainly used to mean a boyfriend and a girlfriend. Therefore, "彼はいる?" probably mean "Do you have a boyfriend?" Of course, it must mean "Is he there?" if you are a man or the speaker already know if you have a boyfriend or not. 彼氏 is a term which means only "a boyfriend." You can't use 彼氏 to mean "he." There is no term which can mean only "a girlfriend." 男友達/女友達 means your male/female friends. Japanese people who are not able to speak English well might say "boyfriend/girlfriend" by mistake to mean male/female friend. 

付き合う
"二人は付き合っている" means "They are boyfriend and girlfriend / They are seeing each other." "付き合う" also can be used when you go somewhere with someone. 
買い物に付き合って - Can you go shopping with me?

別れる
"別れる" means "to break up with a girlfriend/boyfriend." It's also used when two people say goodbye and go to different destinations. Therefore, "昨日、彼とカフェで別れた" can be read as "I broke up with him at the cafe yesterday" and "We said goodbye at the cafe yesterday."

気がある
"気がある" is used when someone seems to like/love another person, but they haven't expressed it yet.
彼女はあなたに気があるみたい。デートしたら？
She seems to be interested in you. Why don't you go out for date with her?

二股かける
It means to be seeing two different boys/girls at the same time.
彼が二股かけてたの!、もう別れる - I'm going to break up with him because I've found out that he's seeing another girl.
