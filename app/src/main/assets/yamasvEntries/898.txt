Using 〜だけに

だけに means "because." It's similar to から/ので, but it's mainly used when you want to stress the reason that is followed by it.

彼は日本に15年住んでいるだけに、ネイティブと同じくらい流暢に日本語を話せる。
- He can speak Japanese fluently like a native speaker because he has lived in Japan for 15 years.

彼のアパートは東京駅の近くにあるだけに、家賃がとても高い。
- Since his flat is near by Tokyo station, the rent is really expensive.


Like から/ので, it can also follow an adjective.

彼女はとてもきれいなだけに、多くの男の子が興味を持っている。
- Since she is very pretty, a lot of boys are interested in her.

そのレストランは高いだけに、金持ちしか訪れない。
- Since the restaurant is expensive, only rich people visit there.


It can also follow a noun.

彼は日本人だけに、侍について詳しい。
- Since he is Japanese, he knows about samurai a lot.

土曜日の夜だけに、このレストランは混んでいる。
- Since it's Saturday evening, this restaurant is busy.

(If you want to use から/ので after a noun, you have to say だから/なので.)
