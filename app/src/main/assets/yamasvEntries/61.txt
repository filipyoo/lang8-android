ばかり

ばかり has several unique uses.

1.
You can use ばかり to limit something.

彼は、肉 ばかり 食べる - He only eats meat. 
最近、暇な時間はビデオゲーム ばかり している - I always play video games in my free time.

You can list multiple things when you use ばかり like "彼は、カレーとラーメン ばかり 食べる." However, since "彼は、肉ばかり食べる" implies that he doesn't eat vegetables, "彼は、肉と野菜ばかり食べる" sounds unnatural.


2.
Second usage is similar to first one. You can use it to express that it doesn't pass a lot of time from doing something.

A. 昼食を食べた ばかり です - I just ate lunch.
B. 最近、日本に引っ越した ばかり です - I just moved to Japan.
C. この前大きな飛行機事故が起きた ばかり なのにまた起きた - A major plane accident happened again.

The time period which is described by ばかり depends on the context. In sentence A, you can guess I ate lunch within one hour. In sentence B, you can guess I moved within one month. In sentence C, the last major plane accident may happen before one year.
