How to Say "no more than" and "as many/much as" in Japanese

You can say "たった〜しか〜ない" to mean "no more than." It's used when you think the number before しか is small. 

たった20人しかパーティに来なかった。
-No more than 20 people came to the party. 

その車はたった100万円しかしなかった。
- This car cost no more than one million yen. 

週に2回しかジムに行ってない。
- I go to the gym no more than twice a week. 

You can omit たった; it doesn't change the nuance. 


When you are referring a time, you can use "ほんの."

ほんの2時間前にそのレストランに行った。
- I visited the restaurant no more than two hours ago. 




When you think the number is big, you can say "〜も."

20人もパーティに来た。
- As many as 20 people came to the party. 

その車は100万円もした。
- The car cost as much as one million yen. 

週に2回もジムに行く。
- I go to the gym as many as twice a week.
