How to Say "I'm on my way" in Japanese

You can say "今向かっています." It means that you are heading somewhere now.

I've often heard in movies someone said "I'm on my way," even though they had just decided to go:

(On a phone.) 
- "My dad was hit by a car! We are in the ABC hospital now.
- "I'm on my way."

In this case, "今向かっています" sounds unnatural. You should say "すぐ行きます/向かいます."


"行きます" is also used to mean "I'll be there."

３時に行きます。
- I'll be there at three o'clock.
(When you want to say "I'll leave home at three o'clock," you can say "3時に家を出ます.)

すぐ行きます。
- I'll be there right now.
