Using 虫がいい and 人がいい

虫がいい means "selfish" or "asking too much." "虫がよすぎる" is a common phrase used when you are asking too much.

週に2日働くだけで月に30万もらえる仕事を探してる？それは虫がよすぎる。
- Are you looking for a job you can get paid 300 thousand yen a month by just working 2 days a week? You are asking too much.

コーヒー1杯おごったから1週間泊めて欲しい？虫がよすぎるよ。
- Do you want me to let you stay in my home for a week because you bought me just a cup of coffee? That's asking too much.


彼は人がいい means that he's a good person. "人がいい" is mainly used for someone who never refuse your asking, but it also implies that he isn't shrewd or it's easy to deceive him because he never doubt someone's word.

あなたは人がいいから騙されないように気をつけた方がいい。みんながいい人ばかりじゃない。
- You should be more careful not to be deceived because you never doubt someone else. Not all people are good.

彼は人がいいから、いつも損な仕事を引き受ける。
- He isn't shrewd and never refuses your asking, so he always undertakes unprofitable jobs.
