How to Say "That's All" in Japanese.

"それが全てです" is a literal translation of "That's all." That's not bad, but "それだけ" sounds more natural in casual conversation.

なんで仕事辞めたの？ - Why did you quit your job?
働きたくないから。それだけ。 - Because I don't want to work. That's all.

ほっといて! 私の望みはそれだけ。 -  Leave me alone! That's all I want.

彼女は日本人。僕が知っているのはそれだけ。- She's a Japanese person. That's all I know about her.
