The Dictionary Form of Verbs + まで

I explained about "the ta-form of verbs + まで" in the last post. I'll share the usage of "the dictionary form of verbs + まで" in this post.
It's used when although something bad happens, it doesn't cause you trouble because you have another option.

この会社で働きたい人はたくさんいる。君が辞めても別な人を雇うまでだ。
- A lot of people want to work for our company. Even if you quit, we can find a substitution with ease.

君がやらなくても、誰か別な人にやらせるまでだ。
- Even if you won't do this, I'll have someone else do.

私の家は会社の近くだから、バスが大雪で運休になっても歩いて帰るまでです。
- My house is close to my office. If busses are canceled because of the heavy snow, I can walk to my house.


You can use だけ instead of まで in all of the sentences above. However, だけ and まで aren't always interchangeable. When だけ means "all you have to do," you can't say まで instead.
