I will explain about て after receiving a request from coffee-san.

He said he watched the following conversation on a TV program.

浜田：なんで？
遠藤：痛くて

I didn't watch the program but I can imagine that Mr. 遠藤 said "今日、会社を休みます" or something like that before Mr. 浜田 asked "なんで?"
What Mr. 遠藤 wanted to say is "Because my stomach hurt." (Of course, I don't know which part of Mr. 遠藤's body hurt, but it is not a point.)
て in 痛くて is used to express the reason. You can say 痛いから or 痛いので instead of 痛くて.
I will show some examples which is expressing the reason using て.

寒くて、死にそう
暑くて、眠れない
むずかしくて、わからない
早くて、追いつけない
まずくて、食べられない
おいしくて、たくさん食べた

When you are asked the reason for something from someone and you describe it using て, you can omit the sentence after て, the partner will be able to guess what you want to say after て.

Q:なんで来なかったの？
A:勉強が忙しくて（、来れなかった）

Q:なぜ負けたの？
A:相手が強すぎて（、勝てなかった）
