Using もう and まだ

When もう is used in a positive form, it means "already."

彼はもう来た。
- He has already come.


When もう is used in a negative form, it means "no longer."

彼はもう来ない。
- He will no longer come.


When もう is used in a positive question form, it means "yet."

彼はもう来た?
- Has he come yet?

(When you are surprised that he has come earlier than expected and want to say "Has he come already??" you can say "彼はもう来たの??")


When もう is used in a negative question form, it means "no longer."

彼はもう来ない?
- Does he no longer come?


When まだ is used in a positive form, it means "still" or "more."

彼はまだ独身だ。
- He is still single.

人はまだ来る。
- More people will come.


When まだ is used in a negative form, it means "not yet."

彼はまだ来ない。
- He hasn't come yet.


When まだ is used in a positive question form, it means "still."

彼はまだ独身？
- Is he still single?


When まだ is used in a negative question form, it means "yet."

彼はまだ来ない?
- He hasn't come yet?


(If I understand correctly, ) もう is tricky for Both English and Japanese speakers because it means "already" when it's used in a positive assertive form, but it means "yet" when it's used in a positive question form.
