Using 玉にキズ

玉にキズ is a common phrase. The 玉 means a glass ball, the metaphor of something brilliant, and the キズ means a scratch. 玉にキズ is used to indicate a small fault of something really good.

東京は清潔で安全で行くところがたくさんあるけど、物価が高いのが玉にキズだ。
- Tokyo is clean, safety and has a lot of places to visit, but it's expensive.

彼は最高の選手だけど、怪我が多いのが玉にキズだ。
- He's the best player. If I had to find his weakness, it'd be that he's often injured.

このノートPCはデザインもいいし、早くて、軽い。バッテリーの寿命が短いのだけが玉にキズだ。
- This laptop has good design, runs fast, and is light. I have no complaint, except the life time of the battery.


If they just say "君は怒りっぽいのが玉にキズだ," it implies that you are almost perfect except the fault you get angry easily.
