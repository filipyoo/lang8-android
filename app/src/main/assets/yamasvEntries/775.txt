The Difference Between 彼に会う And 彼と会う

They are very similar, but there is a little difference between them. 彼と会う is used when both you and he agree to see each other. 彼に会う implies that only you want to. Therefore, when you are going to his house or office without an appointment, you can't say 彼と会いに行く, you need to say 彼に会いに行く.

The same rule can be applied for some other verbs.

彼と話す means to talk about something with him. 彼に話す means to report something to him.

彼と相談する means to discuss something with him. 彼に相談する means to listen to his advice.

彼とキスする means to kiss with him. 彼にキスする means to kiss to him. 

私は彼と似ている means that you and he look like each other. 私は彼に似ている means that you look like him, and implies that the opposite is not true. For example, we say "あの雲は犬に似ている(that cloud looks like a dog)", but don't say "あの雲は犬と似ている" because the opposite is an unnatural expression.
