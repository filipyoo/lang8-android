Using また

また means "too/again." Particle も is used after the subject. In this case, you can omit また because も also means "too/again," 

今日も(また)暑い。
- It's hot today again.

私も(また)学生です。
- I'm a student too.


また is also used to mean "very." In this case, particle は is used after the subject. It's used when you are surprised.

この料理はまた美味しいね。
- This dish is delicious!

今日はまた暑い。
- It's very hot today.
(またまた暑い is a correct expression. One また means "very," and the other また means "again." Therefore, it means "It's very hot again," but it may not be a common expression.)



また is often used in a casual conversation.

"またね" means "Goodbye" or "See you again." "またな," which is used by men, has the same meaning.

"またまたぁ!" means "You must be kidding again!"

"まただよ/またかよ" means "it happens again" or "it's started again." It's used when you are bored or disgusted. For example, when your boss starts talking the same boring joke again.
