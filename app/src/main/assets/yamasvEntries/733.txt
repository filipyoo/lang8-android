The Omission Of The Subject In Japanese

In English, when you say "Tom is my brother," The name "Tom" is stored in a box named "HE." Therefore, you can refer to Tom by saying "he" in the next sentence:
"Tom is my brother. He is sixteen years old."

The same mechanism works about the subject in Japanese. There is a box named "SUBJECT" and "私" is stored in it as the default. Therefore, you can omit the subject 私は when you are talking about yourself:
日本語の勉強が好きです -  I like studying Japanese.
(You don't need to say "私は" in this sentence.)

When you say "トムは日本語の先生です," "トム" is stored in the box." Therefore, if you say "日本語の勉強が好きです" after it, the subject of the second sentence is "トム."
トムは日本語の先生です。- Tom teaches Japanese.
日本語の勉強が好きです -  He likes studying Japanese.

If the person who likes studying Japanese is you, you can't omit 私は in the second sentence. 
トムは日本語の先生です。- Tom teaches Japanese.
私は、日本語の勉強が好きです -  I like studying Japanese.


The similar rule can also be applied to the object of a verb. The verb 作る, which means "to make/cook," needs the object, so the listener would be confused if you just say "私は作ります." However, if the object is implied by using it in a previous sentence or clause, you can omit it.

店に行ったけど、閉まっていた。
- I went to the store, but it was closed.
(You don't need to say "'店は'閉まっていた" or "'そこは'閉まっていた.")

ピザが好きです。よく作ります。
- I like pizza. I often cook it.
(You don't need to say "よく'ピザを'作ります" or "よく'それを'作ります".)

弟はピザが好きです。よく作ります。
- My brother likes pizza. He often cooks it.
(If you want to say "I often cook it for him," you have to say ”私は" because the subject is changed.)

トムは日本語の学校の生徒です。(私は)よく(彼と)一緒に(日本語を)勉強します。
- Tom is a student of Japanese language school. I often study Japanese with him.
You can omit "私は," "彼と" and "日本語を."



When you use a pronoun in English, it might be omitted in Japanese.
