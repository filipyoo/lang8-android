Using ちょっと

ちょっと is a casual version of 少し, which means "a little."

このスープはちょっとしょっぱい。
- This soup is a little bit salty.

今日はちょっと暑くない?
- It's a little hot today, isn't it?

ちょっと遅れます。
- I'll be late a little.


It's also used to talk to someone by itself when you are upset. It's mainly used by women.

ちょっと! 赤ちゃんのそばでタバコを吸わないで!
- Hey! Don't smoke around my baby!

ちょっと! 私があなたの財布を盗(と)ったって言ってるの?
- Wait a minute! Are you saying that I stole your wallet?
In this case, the ちょっと is a short version of ちょっと待って!

ちょっと! この店の責任者は誰?
- You! Who is in charge of this shop?

It's very rude to talk to someone like these when the listener did nothing wrong.
