Agreement of Verb Tense in Japanese, 2

Edison was an inventor. He developed a lot of devices.
- エジソンは発明家でした。たくさんの装置を開発しました。
This Japanese sentence sounds a little unnatural. Since he is famous for inventing many things even now, "エジソンは発明家です" sounds more natural. It doesn't matter whether he lives now or not.  Similarly, you can say "ジョージ・ワシントンは初代大統領です" or "ベーブ・ルースは偉大な野球選手です."  I don't say that it's incorrect to use the past tense in these sentences, but using the present tense sounds more natural. This rule can be applied when a noun is used as the predicate. You can't use the present tense when a verb is used as the predicate. Therefore, you can't say "たくさんの装置を発明します."
On the other hand, if an actor was very famous before, but no one remembers him now, you should say "彼は有名な俳優でした." Using the present tense sounds unnatural in this case even if he is working as an actor now. 


I bought a new car last month. It was a new Porsche.
- 先月車を買いました。ポルシェの新型です。
You can also say "ポルシェの新型でした" if you don't have the car anymore, but you should use the present tense if you still own the car now.

My father took me to a dreamlike place when I was a child. It was Disney Land.
- 子供の時、お父さんが、夢の様なところに連れて行ってくれました。ディズニーランドです。
"ディズニーランドでした" sounds unnatural. "ディズニーランドです" sounds more lively and matches with the expression "夢の様な."


You can use the present tense of verbs when you want to describe what you saw really lively.

昨日すごくびっくりした。コンビニにブラッド・ピットがいるんだよ / いたんだよ!
I was really surprised yesterday. There was Brad Pitt in the convenience store!

この前の試合のメッシはすごかった。一人で5点決めるんだよ / 決めたんだよ!
Messi was amazing in the last game. He scored five goals in the game.
