You can omit なかなか in all of the sentence above, but it removes the nuance that you've been trying to do it.



When なかなか is used with a positive form, it implies "than expected."

この料理はなかなか美味しい。
- This dish isn't bad. 

彼の日本語はなかなか上手だ。
- His Japanese isn't bad.

この仕事はなかなか大変だ。
- This job isn't easy.

When the sentence in which なかなか is used has a positive nuance, you can omit the adjective, so you can say この料理はなかなかだ or 彼の日本語はなかなかだ. On the other hand, you can't say この仕事はなかなかだ instead of この仕事はなかなか大変だ. It sounds positive, such as "This job is interesting" or "This job is easy and brings me a lot of money."
