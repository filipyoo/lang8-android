The Difference Between 彼女と会った and 彼女に会った.

"AとBが〜した" is used when A and B did same action. Therefore, you can interchange A and B.
For example:
You can rewrite "トムとジェリーが喧嘩した" as "ジェリーとトムが喧嘩した."

"AがBに〜した" means "A did something for B." In this sentence B is an objective of the action. Therefore, You cannot interchange A and B in this case.
"トムとジェリーにキスした" and "ジェリーとトムにキスした." has different meaning.

Therefore, 彼女と会った implies that you and she wanted to see each other. On the other hand, 彼女に会った implies that you wanted to see her, but the listener cannot know whether she wanted to see you or not.

(If you happened to see her at somewhere, you can use both of them. However, たまたま彼女と会った sounds as if you and she are nice to each other. たまたま彼女に会った sounds as if you and she are not nice to each other so much.)
