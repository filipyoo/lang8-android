What Do You Say "Who do you think I am?" and "Who do you think you are?" in Japanese

When someone is rude to you, you can say "私を誰だと思ってるんだ?" to mean "Who do you think I am?" 

私を誰だと思ってるんだ？　市長だぞ。
- Who do you think I am? I'm the mayor.

It's mainly used when you think you are an important person and the listener doesn't know who you are. If they know you, you should say 何 instead of 誰.

私を何だと思ってるの? メイドじゃなくて妻なのよ。
- Who do you think I am? I'm your wife, not a maid!

ボスは俺を何だと思ってるんだ? 奴隷じゃないんだぞ。
- Who does my boss think I am? I'm not a slave!


When someone is rude, you can say "自分を何様だと思ってるの?" to mean "Who do you think you are?

自分を何様だと思ってるんだ? お客様に失礼な態度を取るんじゃない!
- Who do you think you are? Don't be rude to our customers!

何様(なにさま) is the key word of this expression. You can simply say "何様のつもり?" or "何様?" to mean "who do you think you are?"
