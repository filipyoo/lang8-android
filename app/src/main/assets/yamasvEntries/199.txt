The usage of もはや.

もはや has two meanings:
(1) anymore / no longer / any longer
(2) now / already.

However, the second meaning is rarely used.


When もはや is used to mean "anymore / no longer / any longer," it is followed by a negative sentence in many cases. It is used when something has changed and you can't restore it to its former state.

もはや 手遅れです.
It's too late.

彼は日本語をマスターしたので、もはや 通訳は必要ない.
He doesn't need a translator any longer because he has mastered Japanese.

彼は、もはや 怠け者ではない.
He is not a lazy guy any longer.
(This sentence in Japanese implies that he was lazy before, and the speaker believes that he wouldn't be lazy again.)

カセットテープは、もはや 使われていない.
The cassette tape is no longer in use at all.


You can use すでに instead of もはや.

すでに 手遅れです.
彼は日本語をマスターしたので、すでに 通訳は必要ない.
彼は、すでに 怠け者ではない.
カセットテープは、すでに 使われていない.

However, もはや has the strong nuance of "you can't restore to its former state."





( I don't know the difference between "no longer" and "any longer." Could someone teach me?)
