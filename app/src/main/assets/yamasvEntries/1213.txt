Using あと and のち

後 can be pronounced as both あと and のち. のち sounds more formal. They both can follow the ta-form of verbs.

履歴書を拝見した後(あと/のち)、面接の日をお知らせします。
- We'll inform you the date of the job interview after examine your resume.
(Be careful. When you use 後, the ta-form of verbs is always used even when you are talking about the future.)

に can follow the 後.
履歴書を拝見した後(あと/のち)に、面接の日をお知らせします。

You can also say あとで, but can't say のちで.
○ 履歴書を拝見した後(あと)で、面接の日をお知らせします。

You can say あとで by itself to mean "later" when you are talking about the future. You can't say のちで in this case.
