Using もし

As you know, もし means "if." However, we don't use もし so often because there are other conditional expressions: たら, なら, ば, etc. もし is mainly used when the possibility is low. 

もし大統領になれたら、...
If I could become the president...

もし宝くじが当たったら、...
- If I won the lottery, ...

If you say "もし明日雨が降ったら," it implies that you don't think that it will be raining tomorrow. If it's a rainy season and the weather report says that it will be raining tomorrow too, you wouldn't say もし; you would simply say "明日雨が降ったら."


Since using もし implies that the speaker is thinking that the possibility is low, もし is also used when the hypothesis is bad for the listener.

もし試験に落ちたら、どうするの？
- If you fail the exam, what will you do?

もし彼女にプロポーズを断られたら、...
- If she doesn't accept your proposal, ...

The possibility of failure of the exam or that of being declined the proposal must be very higher than that of winning of the lottery, but the speaker is trying to imply that they don't expect the result by using もし.
