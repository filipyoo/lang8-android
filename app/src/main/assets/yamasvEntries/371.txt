How to Seek an Agreement or Sympathy Casually in Japanese

You can use "〜よね？" to seek an agreement or sympathy in casual conversations.

この料理おいしいよね？- This dish is very good, isn't it? 
You can use this Japanese expression when you have already eaten the dishes and want to seek an agreement with another person who has also already eaten it. If you haven't eaten the dish or you merely want to know another person's impression, you should say "この料理おいしい?"

"〜ない？" also has the same nuance as "〜よね?" If you say "この料理おいしくない" with a flat intonation, that means "This dish isn't good." However, if you say "この料理美味しくない?" with a rising intonation, that means "This dish is delicious; you must agree."

私は正しいよね? = 私は正しくない?
Don't you think I'm right? / I know I'm right! / Everybody must agree with me.


"〜よね?" is also used with negative forms.

この料理、おいしくないよね?
This dish isn't good, is it? / I don't think this dish is good. I know you'll agree with me.
