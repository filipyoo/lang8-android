Present tense of verbs + つもり

つもり have several meanings. In this post, I would like to explain in the case of when it comes after present tense of verbs.

1.
It is mainly used to describe your future plan:

来月日本に行く つもりです。
I'm going to Japan next month.

その会議には、私も参加する つもりです。
I'm going to attend the meeting too.

2.
You can also use つもり to express your strong will. ”医者になりたい" means "I want to be a doctor." The speaker is just expressing his desire. He might not be aware of how hard it is; he might be just interested in a career you can make big money. On the other hand, if you say "医者になるつもりです," it implies that you know how hard it is and you are going to make efforts to be a doctor.

"9月から大学に行く つもりです" is an expression to describe your plan. On the other hand, "大学でしっかり勉強する つもりです" is an expression to show your strong will.



Be careful. You can use つもり to describe the plan of yourself, but you should not use it to ask the other person's plan.
"When will you come to here?" is a literal translation of "いつ、ここに来るつもりですか."  However, this sentence in Japanese sounds as if you say "Why you don't come here? You must come here soon." You should say "いつ、ここに来る予定ですか?"
"どういうつもり?" or "何のつもり?" are common phrases when you get angry with someone's behavior and blame it.
