たら/なら

"If I go to Japan, I want to see Mt. Fuji." 
You can translate this sentence into the following Japanese sentences by using たら or なら. Both have almost the same meanings in this case.

○ 日本に行っ たら、富士山を見たい   
○ 日本に行く なら、富士山を見たい 


I will explain the difference between たら and なら by showing some examples in other cases.

1.
You can't use なら when you are talking about a past fact.
○ きのう、公園に行っ たら、猫がいた - When I went to the park yesterday, I saw a cat.
x きのう、公園に行った なら、猫がいた 


2.
You should use たら when you are talking about the future thing which is a sure to occur soon.

彼が来 たら、教えて - Let me know when he comes.

This expression gives an impression that you know he will come soon.

You can say "彼が来た なら、教えて", but this expression gives an impression that you are not sure whether he will come or not.


3.
There is an interesting usage of なら. You can put なら after a noun like this.

彼 なら、成功するはず - If he tries this, I am sure he will succeed (because he has enough capacity.)
ラーメン なら、行かない - If you will go to ramen restaurant, I won't go with you.
そのこと なら、彼がくわしい - If you are looking for information about that, you should ask him because he knows much about that.
