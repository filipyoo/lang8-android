What is the difference between たくさん and すごく?
たくさん means "many/much" and すごく means "very".
Therefore, "たくさん苦労した" give the impression that you have experienced a lot of trouble. If you say "すごく苦労した", we feel you had a very hard time.

"たくさん疲れた" is an unnatural and childish expression, you should say "すごく疲れた."
