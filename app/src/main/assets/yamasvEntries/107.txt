もう / まだ

"まだ + ある" means "there are further …," and "もう + ない" means "there is no other ... ."

まだ 質問はありますか？
Do you have further questions?

まだ 質問があり ます。
I have other questions.

もう 質問はありま せん。
I have no other question.

まだ 宿題が残っています。
I haven't finish my homework yet.

もう 宿題は残っていません。
I have finished my homework.



"まだ + negative expression" implies "not … yet."

まだ 質問はありません means "I have no question yet." It implies you have understood all at this time but you are sure you will have some questions.

まだ その花は咲いてません。
The flower has not bloomed yet. 
(It implies the flower will bloom soon. It is unnatural to say "桜はまだ咲いていません" in summer, because the cherry blossoms bloom in spring.)

まだ 日本には行っていません。
I haven't been to Japan yet. 
(It implies that you have a plan to go to Japan. If you don't have the plan, you shouldn't use まだ.)


"もう + positive expression" implies that something happens earlier than expected.

もう 着いた。
We had arrived before schedule.

'まだ' ２月なのに、'もう' その桜は咲いている。
The cherry blossoms even though it's only February.
