Clause That Modifies A Noun

When clause modifies a noun, it's always placed before the noun.

- That man who wears glasses is my dad.

私は、電子機器を作っているソニーの工場で働いている。
- I work in Sony's factory, which make electronic devices.

教える気のない先生が嫌いだ。
- I hate some teachers who don't have a passion to teach.

テーブルの上にあったチョコレートはどこに行った?
- Where is the chocolate that was on the table?

(We often say "どこに行った?" when we are looking for something which is supposed to be at a certain place. You can say it for things. Of course, we know that chocolate can't walk.)
