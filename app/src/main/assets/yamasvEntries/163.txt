The difference between は and が from viewpoint of "specific or general."

くじら が、ほ乳類です。 (Whales are a mammal.)

If you start your speech like this without preamble, we would be confused because が is used to refer to a specific thing. You should say "くじら は、哺乳類です" if you want to talk about general characters of whales.


近くに銀行 は ありますか？ (Is there a bank near here?)
This sentence implies that the speaker doesn't know whether there is a bank near hear or not. A bank the speaker refers to is not a specific bank.

近くに銀行 が ありますか？ 
On the other hand, this sentence implies that the speaker knows that there is a bank near here but they don't know where it is, because they use が after 銀行.



これ が 妻の写真です。先週、結婚したんです。- Here is a photo of my wife, we got married last week.
This sentence sounds unnatural if you start a conversation like this, because the listener doesn't know that you have a wife until you talk about your marriage. You should say "これ は 妻の写真です。先週、結婚したんです."

先週、結婚したんです。これ が 妻の写真です。
On the other hand, this sentence sounds natural because you mention first about your marriage.
