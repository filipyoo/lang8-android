Using 例の

例の is used to refer to something the listener can easily identify without hearing detailed information. It's similar to "the" in English. If I start a conversation with "Have you seen the movie?," you can't get which movie I'm referring to. However, if I've told you before that "'Frozen' was awesome!" many times, you must easily understand which the movie is.

例のラーメン屋に行ってみた。すごく美味しかった。
- I visited the ramen restaurant (you've recommended before). It was delicious.

例の場所で待っている。
- I'll wait for you at the place (where we usually meet).

クリントンは例の不適切な関係を持った女性のことを時々思い出すんだろうか?
- I wonder whether Bill Clinton sometimes remembers the girl who he had inappropriate relationship with or not. 
(I think many of you can understand who the girl is.)


You can use "あの" instead of "例の" in all of the sentences above.
