Using ～ずに済む

～ずに済む is used when you can avoid something you don't want to.

今日は上司が休みだったので、つまらないジョークを聞かずに済んだ。
- I didn't have to hear my boss's boring joke today because he took a day off.

クレジットカードを持っていれば、現金をたくさん持ち歩かずに済む。
- You don't have to carry a lot of cash if you have credit cards.

学生の頃もっと勉強していたら、こんなつまらない仕事に就かずに済んだかもしれない。
- If I had studied harder when I was a student, I might not have to take such a monotonous job.


It's always follow an action you don't want to, so 彼と会わずに済む implies you don't want to see him.
