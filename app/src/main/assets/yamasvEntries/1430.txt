Repeating What the Listener Said

Japanese people usually omit the subject when it's implied, so it sounds natural to repeat only the verb what the listener said, while you repeat the subject and the verb by using a pronoun and a pro-verb in English.

ジョコビッチは昨夜決勝で負けた。
負けたの? 信じられない。
- Đoković lost in the final last night.
- Did he? I can't believe it.

彼のことを愛してるの？
(昔は)愛してた。
- Do you love him?
- I did.

奥さんもパーティに来るの?
来るよ。
- Is your wife also coming to the party?
- She is.



When you use a suru-verb, you can also omit the stem in some cases.
彼女は結婚しているの?
はい、してます。
- Is she married?
- Yes, she is.

彼が逮捕されたって知ってた?
逮捕されたんですか?
- Did you know that he was arrested.
- Was he?
逮捕する is also a suru-verb, but omitting 逮捕 in the answer somehow sounds unnatural. I think it's because the action, being arrested, is surprising to the listener.
