Using なんか

なんか is a casual version of 何か, which means "something."

なんか冷たいものが飲みたい。
- I'd like something cold to drink.

なんかおかしい。
- Something is wrong.

You can also use なんか to mean "somehow," which is used when you don't know why. You can't say 何か instead in this case.

なんかこの部屋は暑い。エアコン止めた?
- Somehow this room is hot. Did you turn off the air conditioner?

なんか彼のことが好きじゃない。
- Somehow I don't like him.

日本語は上手じゃないけど、日本語で話すのはなんか楽しい。
- Although my Japanese isn't good, somehow it's fun to speak it.


なんか can follow a noun you have negative impression. You can also say なんて instead in this case.

日本語なんか嫌いだ。難しすぎる。
- I don't like Japanese. It's too difficult.

私の国では生の魚なんか誰も食べない。気持ち悪い。
- Nobody eats uncooked fish in my country. It's disgusting.

When you want to say なんか after a verb, you need to add の after the verb. 

一日中部屋で本を読むのなんかつまらない。
- It's boring to read a book all the day in a room.

言葉の通じない外国に一人で住むのなんか想像できない。
- I can't imagine to live alone in abroad where you don't speak the language.

なんて sounds more natural in this case. You don't have to add の when you use it.
一日中部屋で本を読むなんてつまらない。
言葉の通じない外国に一人で住むなんて想像できない。
