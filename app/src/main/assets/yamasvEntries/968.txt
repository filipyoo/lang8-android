Using だって

When you tell someone what you heard or read in a casual conversation, you can say 〜だって:

日本語の先生は来月日本に帰るんだって。
- I heard that our Japanese teacher are returning to Japan next month.

友だちが言ってたけど、日本じゃ電車はいつも時間通りに来るんだって。
- My friend said that the trains always come on time in Japan.

この本によると、日本じゃチップを払わなくていいんだって。
- This book says that you don't have to pay tip in Japan.


When you want to know that something is true, you can use "だって?" You need to use a rising intonation in this case.

来月日本に帰るんだって? 
- I heard that you are returning to Japan next month. Is that true?

日本じゃ電車はいつも時間通りに来るんだって?
- Is that true that the trains always come on time in Japan?

日本じゃチップを払わなくていいんだって?
- Is that true that you don't have to pay tip in Japan?


When a sentence starts with だって, it means "because." It's used in a casual conversation.

君は日本人だと思っていた。だって日本語がとても流暢だから。
- I thought you were Japanese because you speak Japanese fluently.

なんでパーティに来なかったの？
だって車が壊れてたから。
- Why you didn't come to the party?
- Because my car broke down.


When だって comes after a noun, it means "even."

日本人なら子供だってこの漢字は読める。
- Even children can read this kanji if they are Japanese.

こんな軽いバッグは小さな女の子だって持ち上げられる。
- Even a little girl can lift this light bag.
