Common mistake about "〜から来ました"


It's unnatural to use "〜から来ました" to describe where you live now or where you were born. "カナダから来ました" means "I came here from Canada." You can't say "カナダから来ました" if you are in Canada now; you can only say "カナダから来ました" when you move to somewhere else or you visit somewhere else.

Recently, it's often used on the net in different meaning. "〜から来ました" is used to explain how did you know the site: "YouTubeから来ました,"  "Googleから来ました" or so on.
"YouTubeから来ました" means "I visit this site by clicking a hyperlink on a YouTube page."
