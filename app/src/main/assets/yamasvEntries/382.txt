Describing Characteristics Simply

When you want to say "That person who wears a blue tie is my boss," you can say "あの青いネクタイの人が私のボスです" instead of "あの青いネクタイをしている人が私のボスです." You can omit a verb when you want to describe characteristics simply. I think this is the same as that you can use "with" to describe characteristics in English.

あのポニーテールが私の娘です。
(あの髪の毛をポニーテールにしている子が私の娘です。)
That girl with a ponytail is my daughter.

あの眼鏡の人は私のおじです。
(あの眼鏡をかけてる人は私のおじです。)
That man with glasses is my uncle.

白いスカートの女性が、私の母です。
(白いスカートをはいている女性が、私の母です。）
That woman with white skirt is my mother.

あの赤い屋根が私の家です。
That house with a red roof is mine.


When you are watching a team sports game like soccer on TV and you don't know any player's name, you can refer to the player only by his uniform color and number like this:

赤の10番はうまいね。なんて名前?
The player who wears red uniform number 10 is excellent. Do you know his name?
