Using もっとも

(Be careful. もっとも I'll explain on this page is different from 最も. The latter means "the most.")

もっとも is a conjunction, which is used to negate the listener's impression that is obtained from the previous sentence. The sentence that follows もっとも often ends with けど or が. 

先生は僕の日本語はクラスで一番だって言った。もっとも、生徒は３人しかいないけど。
- My teacher told me that my Japanese is the best in this class. Actually, there are only three students in this class.
(The listener would think that his Japanese is excellent, but the second sentence negates the impression.)

友達が2000ドル入った財布を無くした。もっとも、彼は金持ちだから全然気にしてないけど。
- My friend lost his wallet, which contained two thousand dollars. However, he doesn't mind it at all because he is rich.
(The listener would think that the friend must be depressed, but the second sentence negates the impression.)

明日は初めてスキーをする。もっとも、雪が降ったらだけど。
- I'm going to ski tomorrow for the first time. ... If it would be snowing.


もっとも is similar to ただし. You can say ただし instead of もっとも in all sentences above. However, it sounds slightly unnatural to use もっとも when the second sentence describes exceptions.
You shouldn't say もっとも instead of ただし, in the following sentences.

今日はコーヒーは無料です。ただしおかわりは有料です。
- You can drink coffee for free today, but you have to pay if you'd like another one.

僕の車を使ってもいいよ。ただし、月曜日までに返してね。
- You can use my car, but don't forget to return it by Monday.
