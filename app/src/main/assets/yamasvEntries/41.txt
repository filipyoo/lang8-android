つもりです / 予定です

Since there is no future tense in Japanese, you can say future plan using present tense.

A. 昨日、勉強した - I studied yesterday.
B. 今、勉強する - I am studying now.
C. 明日、勉強する - I will study tomorrow.

You can talk about your future plan by using つもりです or 予定です。
The following two sentences have the same meaning as C.

明日、勉強するつもりです - I will study tomorrow.
明日、勉強する予定です - I will study tomorrow.


However, you can not use つもりです and 予定です when you are talking about your plan which you make just now.
You can use them only when you are talking about your plan which is made before.

X. 飲みに行く？  - How about a drink?
Y. はい、行きます
Z. はい、行くつもりです 

You can guess that Z had a plan to go drink since before X invited them.
