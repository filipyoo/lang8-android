Causative and Passive Verbs

1.
In case of 5-row conjugation verbs, there are two forms of causative and passive form:
読む - 読ませられる / 読まされる.
作る - 作らせられる / 作らされる.
待つ - 待たせられる / 待たされる.
行く - 行かせられる / 行かされる.

We usually use the latter form. You can make them by adding される after a-form of the verb.
(There are exceptions. See the ビクトリア's comment below.)

2.
In case of 1-row conjugation verbs, you can make a causative and passive form by replacing る with させられる.

食べる - 食べさせられる.
覚える - 覚えさせられる.
並べる - 並べさせられる.


Be careful, causative and passive verbs are used when you are forced to do something and you have complaints about that in most cases.

先生に本を読まされた.
I was forced to read the book by my teacher.

母に１時間も待たされた.
I had to wait for my mother for one hour. / I was forced to wait for my mother for one hour.

彼女の手料理を食べさせられた。
I was forced to eat her homemade meal.
(This Japanese sentence implied that the meal was awful. You should say 彼女の手料理を食べさせてもらった if you don't want to make her angry (even if it was awful.)
