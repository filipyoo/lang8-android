Using お Before A Verb in Polite Expressions 

You can use お before the masu stem of verbs when you are talking with a person you should show respect. If the listener does the action, になる follows the verb. On the other hand, if you do the action, します follows it.

Unfortunately, there are exceptions. You can't say お見になる; you need to say ご覧になる. You need to say お召しになる instead of お着になる.
