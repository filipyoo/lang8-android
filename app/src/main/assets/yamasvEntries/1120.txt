Sentences That Start with Particle と

Particles usually follow another term, but you can start a sentence with particle と when you refer to what the listener said. You should pause a little after the と in this case.

彼はもう帰ったの？
と、思う。
- Has he gone home yet?
- I think so.

彼は本当に今日来るの？
と、言ってた。
- Is he really coming today?
- He said so.

地球が太陽の周りを回ってるって信じられる？
と、教科書には書いてあったけど、信じられない。
- Do you believe that the earth's going around the sun?
- The textbook said so, but I don't believe it.

You can also say って instead. It sounds more casual.
