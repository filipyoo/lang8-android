Te-form of Verbs + の

ての (the te-form of verbs + の) can modify a noun which follows after it. 

社員全員揃ってのミーティング - A meeting which all employees are supposed to attend.

衛星電話を使っての会話 - A conversation over a satellite telephone.

全力を尽くしての結果 - The result after doing all we could do.

映画スターを招いてのパーティ - The party which many movie stars are invited to. 

You can use た instead of ての in all of the above expressions. However, "社員全員揃ったミーティング" sounds a little weird when it is used in a sentence which describes a future schedule because it's not sure that all employees will be able to attend the meeting.
