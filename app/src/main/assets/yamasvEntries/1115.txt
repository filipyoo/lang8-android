Particle after Date or Time Expression

When you talk about an action you've done or you are going to do, you don't need to use a particle after the date when you use
昨日/今日/明日/
先週/今週/来週/
先月/今月/来月/
去年/今年/来年.
I think it's similar to that you don't use a preposition before a date in English in similar cases.

昨日、寿司を食べました。
- I had sushi yesterday.

来年、日本に行きます。
- I'm going to Japan next year.


Of course, a particle is necessary if the date is the subject of your sentence.

今日は、私の誕生日です。
- Today is my birthday.


Either using the particle に or not is okay when use 午前, 午後, or day of the week.


午後、彼が来ることになっています。
午後に彼が来ることになっています。
- He's supposed to come this afternoon.
(If use use the particle に, it may sound as if you want to stress the 午後.) 

日曜日、パーティを開きます。
日曜日にパーティを開きます。
- We're going to have a party on Sunday.


When you talk about your routine work, you should use に.

日曜日に英語を教えています。
- I teach English on Sundays.
(If you omit the に, it sounds as if you are talking about the coming Sunday.)

毎月1日に病院に行ってます。
- I go to the hospital every first day of a month.


When you use 毎日, 毎週, 毎月 or 毎年, it can't be followed by a particle.

毎日日本語を勉強しています。
- I study Japanese every day.

毎年免許を更新しないといけません。
- You have to update your license every year.


When you refer a specific time, you can't omit a particle.

3時に電車が来るはずです。
- The train is supposed to come at three o'clock.

私はいつも11時に寝ます。
- I usually go to bed at eleven o'clock.
