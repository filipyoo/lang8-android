Japanese Passive Form and Respectful Form of Verbs

The passive form and the respectful form of a verb are the same in many cases.
For example, 誤解される is the passive form of 誤解する, and is also the respectful form. Therefore "あなたは誤解されている" can be read as two different meanings: "You are misunderstood (by someone.)" and "You are misunderstanding (something)."
(If you say "あなたは誤解されておられる," the listener would know that you used the respectful form.)

Other examples:
その魚は食べられましたか？
- Was the fish eaten? (In this case 食べられた is used as the passive form.)
- Did you eat the fish? (In this case 食べられた is used as the respectful form.)

あなたは、英語を教えられましたか?
- Were you taught English (by someone)?  (In this case 教えられた is the passive form.)
- Did you teach English? (In this case 教えられた is the respectful form.)


あなたは、東京に行かれたことはありますか?
This sentence doesn't make sense if you treat this 行かれた as the passive form of 行った. This 行かれた is the respectful form of 行った. Therefore, this Japanese sentence means ”Have you ever been to Tokyo before?"

When a Japanese sentence doesn't make sense if you treat the verb in that sentence as the passive form even though the passive form is used, the verb could be used as the respectful form. 
To put it the other way around, you don't have to memorize the respectful form because it's the same as the passive form. You can be respectful by using the passive form of the verb.
(Of course, using the respectful form with your friends would sound weird.)
