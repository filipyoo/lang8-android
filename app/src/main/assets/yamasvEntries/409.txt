How to Say "Where were we?" Casually in Japanese

When you forget where did you stop the conversation after something interrupted the conversation, you can say "どこまで話したっけ?"
If you completely forget what you were talking about, you can say "何話してたっけ?"
(を after 何 is often omitted in casual conversation: ”何してるの？," "何食べてるの?," "何しに行くの?" etc.)

When you were about to say something and you suddenly forget what you wanted to say, you can say "何言おうとしてたんだっけ?"
When you went to somewhere doing something and you forget your purpose after you arrived there, you'd say to yourself "何しに来たんだっけ?"

To forget suddenly simple things is called "ど忘れ." "ど忘れした" is a popular expression used when you forget a famous person's name.
