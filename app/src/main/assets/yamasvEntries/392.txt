どの / どっちの / なんの

When you ask someone his favorite movie, for example, you can use どっちの only when there are two choices. 

「スティング」と「ハスラー」どっちの映画がすき?
Which movie do you like: Sting or Hustler? 


If there are three or more choices, you can't use どっちの. You have to use どの.

x「スティング」と「ハスラー」と「ゴッドファーザー」どっちの映画がすき?
o「スティング」と「ハスラー」と「ゴッドファーザー」どの映画がすき?
Which movie do you like: Sting, Hustler or God Father? 


"なんの映画が好き?" sounds ambiguous. The listener wouldn't understand whether you're asking his most favorite movie or you're asking his favorite categories. You should use "どんな" when you want to ask his favorite categories: comedy, SF, love story, etc.

どんな映画が好き?
What kind of movie do you like?

When you want to ask him the most favorite movie, you can say "一番好きな映画は何?"
