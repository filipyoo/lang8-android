The difference between 上がる and 上る.

上 (あ) がる is an expression which is focused on the goal. On the other hand, 上 (のぼ) る is an expression which is focused on the process.

エレベーターで5階に上(あ)がった - I ride the elevator to the fifth floor of the building.
エレベーターが壊れていたので、階段で上 (のぼ) った - I took the stairs because the elevator didn't work.

We use 登(のぼ)る to express to climb a mountain. 上る and 登る has the same pronunciation but different Kanji is used. Since 登る is an expression focused on a process, 頂上に登る is a slightly unnatural expression. 頂上にむかって登る is a natural expression.


あがる has other different meanings.

雨があがる means "The rain has stopped." You can also say 雨がやむ. The latter gives the impression that it may begin to rain again. 雨が上がる is used when the rain has completely stopped and you don't need to worry about rain any more.


あがる also has the meaning of "get nervous."

あがって、うまく話せませんでした
I was nervous so I couldn't speak well.
