Learn Foreign Languages, 300% Faster

I found an impressive opinion in a book titled "Learn English: 300% Faster."

I'd like to share it with you.
As you know, young children learn foreign languages faster than adults do. It's believed that it's concerned with the ability of brains. However, the book says that it's completely wrong. It says that the only reason of that is just because young children aren't  afraid of making mistakes at all. The more you get older, the more you fear to be embarrassed or to make someone uncomfortable by making mistakes. If you don't fear to make mistakes, you can learn foreign languages faster than young children can because you have more knowledge than they do and you can think more logically than they can.
The more you make mistakes, the more you learn.

(I don't remember exactly, so it may be a little different from what the book says.)

The book is written for English learners, but I think most of the tips it teaches are useful for other language learners. (Furthermore, it's cheap.)
