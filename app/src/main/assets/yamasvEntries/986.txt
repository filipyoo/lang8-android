Using 田舎(いなか)

田舎 means the country/countryside.

引退したら田舎に住みたい。
- I'd like to live in the countryside after I retire.

田舎 has a little negative nuance. 田舎者(いなかもの) is a rude expression because it implies "not sophisticated people." You should say "田舎の人" to mean people who live in the countryside.


田舎 is also used to mean your hometown.

田舎はどこですか？
大阪です。
東京生まれの東京育ちです。
- Where are you from? / Where were you born?
- I'm from Osaka.
- I was born and grew up in Tokyo.


生まれはどこですか is another expression to mean "where are you from?" 
"どこで生まれたんですか" is technically correct, but it's not common to ask their hometown. Some people might answer "I was born in a hospital."
