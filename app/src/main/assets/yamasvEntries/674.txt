Using 〜出す

When 出す follow the masu stem of verbs, it means "to begin to 〜:"
走り出す, 泣き出す, 食べ出す, etc.

彼はその手紙を見ると笑い出した。
- He burst out laughing after he read the letter.

彼女はなぜか日本語を勉強し出した。
- She suddenly started studying Japanese for some reason.


〜出す is mainly used when you are surprised or were not expecting the action, so "私は最近日本語を勉強し出した" sounds slightly unnatural because you must know why you started the study. "勉強し始めた" sounds more natural in this case. Similarly, you'd say "雨が降り出した" if it suddenly starts raining. On the other hand, you'd say "雨が降り始めた" if you were expecting it.



There are some exceptions. "探し出す" or ”見つけ出す" has two meanings: "to start looking for" and "to find out." It's mainly used to mean the latter.
