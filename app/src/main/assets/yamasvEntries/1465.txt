How to Read 昨日, 今日 and 明日

昨日, which means yesterday, can be read as きのう or さくじつ; きのう sounds casual and さくじつ sounds formal.

昨日(きのう)、彼の家に行った。(Sounds casual.)
昨日(さくじつ), 彼の家に伺いました。(Sounds formal.)
- I visited his place yesterday.

明日, which means tomorrow, can be read as あした, あす or みょうにち; あした sounds casual and あす sounds formal. みょうにち sounds more formal than あす.

明日(あした)、彼の家に行く。(Sounds casual.)
明日(あす/みょうにち)、彼の家に伺います。(Sounds formal.)
- I'm going to his place tomorrow.

今日 can be read as きょう or こんにち. When it's read as きょう, it means today; when it's read as こんにち, it could also mean today, but it usually means "these days." When you say こんにち to mean "today." it sounds very formal.

今日(きょう)、スマホを買った。
- I bought a smartphone today.

今日(こんにち)では、誰もがスマートフォンを使っている。
- Everybody uses a smartphone these days.


Some people write 今日は to mean "hello," but you should write it in hiragana, こんにちは, because it could be read as きょうは, which confuses the reader.
