How to Say "It's me" on The Phone in Japanese

Most Japanese people say ”私だけど," "僕だけど," "俺だけど, " etc. The だけど doesn't have special meaning in this case. "私です" or "僕です" isn't bad, but it sounds slightly unnatural or too formal because the listener is your close people who can recognize you by just hearing your voice.

If your kid answers the phone, you'd say "お父さんだけど/お母さんだけど" or "パパだけど/ママだけど."
(Japanese people often call themselves their position from the viewpoint of the listener. Therefore, if you were a teacher and the listener were your student, you'd say "先生だけど.")

If the listener isn't your close person and they don't recognize you by just hearing your void, you'd say "〇〇ですが" or "〇〇ですけど." (〇〇 is your name.)
