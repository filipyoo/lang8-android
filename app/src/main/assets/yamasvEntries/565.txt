How to say "What am I supposed to do?" in Japanese.

"To be supposed to 〜" is translated as "〜することになっている" or "〜するはずだ."

He is also supposed to attend the meeting.
彼もその打ち合せに参加することになっている / 参加するはずだ。


When you want to say "What am I supposed to do?," "何をすればいいの(ですか)？" or "どうすればいいの(ですか)?" sounds natural. They can be used both when you merely don't know what to do and when you get angry because someone's instruction is ambiguous. In the latter case, you can say "どうしろって言うの?"
