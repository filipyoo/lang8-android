The Dictionary Form of Verbs + 気

When a question form ends with 気 that follows the dictionary form of verbs, it means you don't understand why someone is going to do enigmatic things. It's often used with 一体 or 本当に.

一体何をする気?
What the hell are you doing?

本当に仕事をやめる気?
Are you really going to quit your job!?

本当にこれを食べる気？
Are you really going to eat this??

奥さんを裏切る気？
Are you really going to betray your wife?


All of the Japanese sentences above imply that the speakers are thinking that you shouldn't do them. What the speakers really want to say are:

一体何をする気? (そんなことはしない方がいい)
You shouldn't do such a stupid thing.

本当に仕事を辞める気?(辞めない方がいい)
You shouldn't quit your job.

本当にこれを食べる気？(食べない方がいい）
You had better not eat this.

奥さんを裏切る気？(裏切るべきじゃない）
You shouldn't betray your wife.
