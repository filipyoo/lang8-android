Connecting Two Short Sentences with けど

(A) この本を買ったけど、面白くなかった。
(B) この本を買ったけど、すごく面白かった。
- (A) I bought this book, but it wasn't interesting.
- (B) I bought this book. It was very interesting.

The けど in the sentence (A) means "but." However, the けど in the sentence (B) doesn't mean anything; it's just used to connect two sentences. To list short sentences like "この本を買った。すごく面白かった。" makes your conversation unnatural, so you should connect the two sentences by using けど if the two have a relation.

The けど in all of the following four sentences have no meanings, just used to connect two sentences.

買い物行くけど、買ってきて欲しいものある？
- I'm going shopping. Is there anything you want me to buy? 

バーベキューパーティをやるんだけど、来ない？
- We're having a barbecue party. Why don't you come?

チョコレートがあるけど、食べる？

けど is sometimes placed at the end of a short sentence.

質問があるんだけど。
- I have a question. / Can I ask you a question?

車を借りたいんだけど。
- I want to borrow your car. / Can I borrow your car?

In a formal conversation, が sounds slightly more natural than けど.
質問があるんですが。
車を借りたいんですが。
