How to Express Conditional By Using と.

と is used to list a noun like this:

カナダ と アメリカを旅行した - I traveled to Canada and America.
買い物 と カラオケを楽しんだ - I enjoyed shopping and karaoke.


You can describe conditional by adding と after a verb.

A. そこに行く と、彼に会える. - If you go to there, you can meet him.


You can use と when you speak about the past. You can add のに at the end of the sentence to emphasize your regret.

B. 昨日、そこに行く と、彼に会えた(のに). - If you went to there, you could meet him.


 If B does not end with のに, You can understand B as "I met him when I went to there." If you want to say this you should say in the following way to avoid misunderstanding.

C. 昨日、そこに行く と、彼に会った. - I met him when I went to there. 


When you deny A, you can use ても.

そこに行っ ても、彼には会えない. - Even if you go to there, you won't meet him.


You can put A, B, and C in another way by using たら. When you use たら, you need to convert the verb.

A'. そこへ行っ たら　彼に会える
B'. 昨日、そこへ行っ たら 彼に会えたのに
C'. 昨日、そこに行っ たら 彼に会った

x そこへ行く たら 彼に会える
