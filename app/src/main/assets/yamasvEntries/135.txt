The difference between なら and たら in conditionals.

なら and たら are used in conditional sentences, but there is a major difference between them.
なら is used based on some information.

A:「今、暇なんだ」 - I have nothing to do now.
B:「暇 なら 手伝って」 - Please help me if you have time.

In the above conversation, B asks A to help B based on information which B got from A's conversation.

If you want someone to help you and you know they have nothing to do, you can say 暇なら手伝って. To put it the other way around, if someone said to you 暇なら手伝って, it implies you look like you have nothing to do. (Or they might think that you always have nothing to do.)


On the other hand, you can use たら without any previous information. When you want to ask someone to help you without knowing their schedule, you should use たら:
「暇だったら 手伝って」
