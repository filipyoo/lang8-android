The Difference Between みたい and らしい

みたい and らしい are used to describe hearsay, and they also are used to describe behavior or looks.
When they are used to describe behavior or looks, there is a clear difference. みたい means "to look like as if" and らしい means "to be supposed to be."
"〜は男みたい" means "〜 looks like as if 〜 is a man." Therefore, it can be used for only a woman. On the other hand, "〜は男らしい" means "〜 behaves the way which a man should do." It's used for only a man.
o 彼女は女らしい
x 彼女は女みたい
o 彼は男らしい
x 彼は男みたい

Similarly, if it's very hot weather and there is no cloud in the blue sky, you should say "今日は夏みたい" if it's not summer, and you should say "今日は夏らしい" if it's summer.
