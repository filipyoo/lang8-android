Learn Japanese from Common Mistakes Japanese people make in English

You must notice that a lot of Japanese people, of course including me, often make the same kind of mistakes. One of the mistakes must be that they don't pay much attention to the difference between singular and plural. The fact implies that there is no difference between singular and plural in Japanese.
Another common mistake might be that they often say "I'm boring" instead of "I'm bored,"  "I'm exciting" instead of "I'm excited," and so on. This tells you that the passive form isn't used when you express your feeling in Japanese. ている, the present continuous form, is used: 退屈している, 興奮している, 驚いている, がっかりしている, etc.
Some people say "Almost people" instead of "Almost all people." It's because there is no difference between ほとんどの人 and ほとんどすべての人.

Most common English mistakes Japanese people make come from the fundamental difference between Japanese and English, so you could learn Japanese from the different point of views by reading English sentences written by Japanese people. If a sentence doesn't sound natural, even if it's grammatically correct, it might be reflected the characteristics of Japanese expression.
