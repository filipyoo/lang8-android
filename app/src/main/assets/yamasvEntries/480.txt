How to say "May I have your autograph?" in Japanese

You can say "サインしてください," "サインを下さい" or "サインをお願いします" to ask a famous person for their autograph. The Japanese phrases are the same as those when a shop clerk uses to ask a customer for their sign when they use a credit card.  

You can't use the term "サイン" to ask someone's star sign. You should say "星座は何ですか" to ask "What's your sign?"
