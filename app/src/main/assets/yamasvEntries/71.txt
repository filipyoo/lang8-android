以来

以来 is used to express the time period from certain past time till now.

○  昨年以来 (this means since last year till now.)
x  おととし以来、昨年まで (You can't use 以来 when time period ends at the past.)
x  来年以来 (You can't use 以来 with the future time.)

以降 / 以後
以降 and 以後 are used to describe start time. You can use both with the future time and the past time. It doesn't matter when the time period ends.

○　おととし以降、昨年まで
○　おととし以後、昨年まで
○　昨年以降、ずっと
○　昨年以後、ずっと
○　来年以降
○　来年以後

You need to use 以降 with other words. On the other hand, you can use 以後 singly. 以後 means "from now" when it is used singly.

以後、私の家でタバコを吸うことは禁止
You can't smoke in my house from now.

x 以降、私の家でタバコを吸うことは禁止


You can use all of them with certain events.
