汚い and きれい

汚れている means "to be dirty" and 散らかっている means "to be untidy / messy."
汚い has the both meanings, therefore "部屋が汚い" can be read as "the room is dirty" and "the room is messy."

きれいにする also has two meanings: "to clean" and "to tidy." 

You can read "部屋が汚いから、きれいにしなさい" as two different meanings:
"Your room is dirty. You should clean it."
"Your room is untidy. You should tidy it."

汚い and きれい can modify abstract things. 汚い means "dirty/unfair" and きれい means "fair" in this case. "汚いお金" or "汚れたお金" means the money you make illegally.

あなたのやり方は汚い - You are unfair! 
汚い言葉を使うな - Don't  use rude words.
彼はいつも汚い手を使う - He always uses dirty tricks.
