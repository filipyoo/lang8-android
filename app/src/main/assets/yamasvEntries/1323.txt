Using さすが

流石(さすが), which is usually written in hiragana, is used to describe that something is good as expected.

日本の寿司はさすがにおいしい。
- Sushi in Japan is delicious as expected.

日本に留学してただけあって、君の日本語はさすがだ。
- Your Japanese are excellent. You didn't study in Japan for nothing.


Suppose someone sang a song very well. You'd say さすが if you already knew that he/she was a great singer. If you didn't, you'd say 上手い or something like that.

You can say さすが to flatter them even if you didn't know that they are great singers or their song wasn't good because it implies that it was good and you already knew it. Apple polishers like this word.


You can also use さすが with a negative form to mean "even ～ can't." When it modifies a noun, の follows it. When it modifies a verb, に follows it.

さすがのメッシも毎試合ハットトリックはできない。
メッシも毎試合ハットトリックはさすがにできない。
- Even Messi can't score hat trick in every game.

さすがの彼も娘を殺すのはためらった。
彼も娘を殺すのはさすがにためらった。
- Even he hesitated to kill his daughter.
(This さすが implies that he was a cruel killer and was supposed to kill everybody without hesitating.)
