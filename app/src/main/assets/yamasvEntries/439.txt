見覚え and 聞き覚え

見覚えがない is used when you have never seen something before. 

Do you know who that guy is? - あの人、誰か知ってる？
No. I haven't seen him before.  - いや、見覚えがない。

There is a car I've never seen before in front of our house. Do you know whose car that is?
- 家の前に見覚えのない車があるけど、誰の車かわかる？
(When it's used to modify a noun, "見覚え'の'ない" sounds more natural.)

Our boss is talking with a stranger. He must be a new employee our boss told before.
- ボスが見覚えのない人と話している。前に話してた新しい社員に違いない。


On the other hand, 見覚えがある is used when you have seen something before, but you can't remember when and where you saw it.

Do you know who that guy is? - あの人、誰か知ってる？
I think I have seen him before, but I can't remember who he is. - 見覚えはあるけど、誰だか思い出せない。

I don't know this actor's name, but I remember his face. I must have seen him before in another movie.
-この俳優の名前は知らないけど、顔に見覚えがある。別な映画で見たに違いない。

I remember the building in this picture. (However, I can't remember where it is.) I must have visited there before.
- この写真の建物には見覚えがある。ここに行ったことがあるに違いない。


You can't use 見覚えがある when you know who/what it is and you can explain about it well.
x 私は妻の顔に見覚えがあります。
x 私はアメリカの国旗に見覚えがあります。



Similarly, 聞き覚えがない is used when you have never heard something before, and 聞き覚えがある is used when you have heard something before, but you can't remember when and where you heard it.
