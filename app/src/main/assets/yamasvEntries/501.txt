How to say "I had my hair cut" in Japanese

"部屋をそうじした" means "I cleaned my room." You don't have to say "自分で (by myself)" because it is implied. 
However, if you say "髪を切った," it means "I had my hair cut" because most people don't cut their hair by themselves. If you cut your hair by yourself, you should say "自分で髪を切った."
Similarly, if you fixed your car by yourself, you should say "自分で車を修理した." If you say "車を修理した," it means "I got my car fixed" unless you are an auto mechanic.
