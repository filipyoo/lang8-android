Some English speakers sometimes use the unnatural Japanese expression when they speak about future like this "明日、学校にいくでしょう."
Although that is a grammatically correct sentence, it sounds very unnatural for Japanese people. We never say that.
On the other hands, Japanese people sometimes made a mistake when they speak about future like this "I go to school tomorrow."
This is because Japanese language has not a future tense. You don't need to think how to convert a verb into the future tense. "明日、学校に行きます" is a correct and natural sentence. If you want to change an expression, you can say "学校にいく予定です" or "学校にいくつもりです."
However,  when you speak about the past, you need to convert a verb into the past tense.
"昨日、学校に行きます" is incorrect. 
"昨日、学校に行きました" is correct.
