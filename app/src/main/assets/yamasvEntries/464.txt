How to Say "He is a good 〜." in Japanese

He's a good teacher.
If you say "彼はいい先生です," it sounds as if he's a professional teacher. If he's not a professional teacher, but he's good at teaching something, you ought to say "彼は教え方が上手い."

He's a good singer. 彼はいい歌手だ。
He's a good driver. 彼はいいドライバーだ。
He's a good cook. 彼はいい料理人だ。

Similarly, all of the Japanese sentences above sounds as if he's a professional. If he isn't a professional, you ought to say:
 彼は歌が上手い。
 彼は運転が上手い。
 彼は料理が上手い。

He's a good student.
"彼は、いい生徒だ" sounds like he's a good boy who never goes against his teacher, rather than that he learns anything quickly. If you want to say that he's smart, then say"彼は飲み込みが早い" or "彼は覚えが速い."
