What Does "なんで来たの?" Mean?

"なんで来たの?" is interpretted as two different meanings:
"How did you come?" and "Why did you come? (You are not supposed to come.)"

You can avoid misunderstanding by asking "どうやって(how)来たの?" or "なぜ(why)来たの?" However, Japanese people prefer なんで in a casual conversation. You need to judge from the context.


なんでそう思うの?
What makes you think so?

なんで日本に来たの？
What brings you to Japan?
(I've heard that "why did you come to Japan?" may sound rude. なんで日本に来たの? doesn't sound rude unless you say it with angry.)

なんで笑ってるの？
What makes you laugh?
("何がおかしいの?" is also correct, but it's often used when you are thinking that someone ridicules you for some reasons.)

なんで時間がかかってるの？
What takes you so long?
