How To Say "I'll be there at three o'clock" in Japanese.

You can say "３時に行きます" to mean "I'll be there at three o'clock." "３時に行きます" doesn't mean "I'll go there at three o'clock."

If you want to say "I'll leave my house at three o'clock," you can say "３時に(家を)出ます."

I'll stay here till three o'clock. - ３時までいます.
I'll be there by three o'clock. - ３時までに行きます/着きます.
I'll be there in three hours. - ３時間で行きます/着きます.

If a Japanese person who isn't good at English says "I'll go there at three o'clock," it probably means "I'll be there at three o'clock."
