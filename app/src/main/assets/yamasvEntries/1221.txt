Using どっちもどっち

どっちもどっち is used when you can't choose one from two. It's often used when both two things aren't good.

二人の男性からデートに誘われた。１人はハンサムだったけどお金持ってないし、もう一人は金持ちだけど見た目が悪かった。どっちもどっちだった。
- Two guys asked me out. One guy was handsome, but poor. Another guy was rich, but wasn't handsome. I couldn't choose one.

このホテルは高すぎるし、あっちは汚いし、どっちもどっちだ。
- This hotel is too expensive. That one isn't clean. Both are to blame.

アパートを探していて、不動産屋さんが今日２つ見せてくれたけど、どっちもどっちだった。
- I'm looking for a flat. A realtor showed me two flats today, but I didn't have a good impression on both of them. They were almost the same.
(It has negative nuance, so if you just say どっちもどっち, it implies you don't have a good impression on both of the two things.)

It sounds unnatural to use it when you are comparing three or more things.


When you can't choose one from two because both are very good, you can say どっちも捨てがたい.

このアパートはすごくきれいだし、もう一つの方はすごく広いし、どっちも捨てがたい.
- This flat is very clean. Another one is very big. I can't choose one.

メッシとネイマールどっちが最高の選手だと思う?
どっちも捨てがたい。
- Which player do you think is the best, Messi or Neymar?
- I think both are the best.
