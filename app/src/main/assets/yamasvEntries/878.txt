上の名前 and 下の名前

As you know, you can write Japanese sentence both from left to right and from top to bottom. When we write our name from top to bottom, the family name is placed above the first name. Therefore, we call family name "上の名前," and first name "下の名前."
 When someone tell you their family name only and you want to know their first name, you can say "下の名前は何ですか？"
Similarly, you can ask "上の名前は何ですか？" when you want to ask their family name. However, 苗字(みょうじ) is more popular than 上の名前 to mean family name.
