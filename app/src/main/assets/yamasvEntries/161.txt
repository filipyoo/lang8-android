わざわざ

わざわざ is similar to せっかく which means "with effort / take the trouble to do," but unlike せっかく, わざわざ has the nuance that you don't need to or you don't want to do it.

せっかく彼のために料理を作ったのに、彼は食べなかった。
I took the effort to make the meal for him, but he didn't eat it.

This sentence in Japanese implies that you wanted to make the meal to make him happy. However, if you say "わざわざ料理を作った," it gives the impression that you didn't want to make the meal.


△ せっかく、小包を送るために郵便局に行ったのに、閉まっていた。
◯ わざわざ、小包を送るために郵便局に行ったのに、閉まっていた。
I took the trouble to go to the post office to send packages, but it was closed.

Since going to the post office itself is not your fun, わざわざ is more natural than せっかく in this sentence.


Since わざわざ has the nuance that you don't need to do it, you can also use わざわざ to express thanks to someone who took the trouble to do something for you.

わざわざ 駅まで見送りに来てくれてありがとう。
Thank you for taking the trouble to come and see me off at the station.

彼は、わざわざ 日本から会いに来てくれた。
He came all the way to see me from Japan.
(This sentence in Japanese has the nuance that the speaker thank him.)

You cannot use せっかく instead of わざわざ in this case.
x せっかく、駅まで見送りに来てくれてありがとう。
x 彼は、せっかく日本から会いに来てくれた。
