Using どちら

どちら is used when you ask where something is. It sounds more polite than どこ.

駅はどちらですか？
- Could you tell me where the station is?


It's also used to ask your background, such as where you from or which company you work for. 

出身はどちらですか？
- Where are you from?

会社はどちらですか？
- Which company do you work for?

学校はどちらですか？
- Which school do you go to? / Which school did you graduate from?

("会社/学校はどちらですか?" can be also used to just ask where the office/school you go to is.")


どちら is also used to let someone choose from two things.

犬と猫、どちらが好きですか?
- Between dogs and cats, which do you like?

When you list three or more things, どちら might sound slightly unnatural. You should say どれ in that case.

赤と白と青のシャツがございます。どれになさいますか？
- We have red, white, and blue shirts. Which color would you like?
(Some people may say that it's acceptable to use どちら when you list three or more things.)
