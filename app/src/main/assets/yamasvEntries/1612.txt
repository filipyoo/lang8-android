Using お茶

お茶 usually means green tea.

静岡県はお茶で有名です。
- Shizuoka prefecture is famous for green tea.

It can be used to mean black tea, coffee or something else to drink, so if someone says "お茶でも飲まない? (Why don't we have a tea?)",  you shouldn't say "お茶は好きじゃありません(I don't like green tea)" even if you don't like it; they are just suggesting to take a break.

You can also use お茶 as a suru-verb in a casual conversation.

あのカフェでお茶しよう。
- Let's get a coffee at that cafe.

あなたとお茶すると落ち着く。
- I feel relaxed when I chat with you over a coffee.
