Using 〜は〜です

The following Japanese sentences might sound strange for English speakers, but all of them are correct and sound natural. I think one of the most confusing things in Japanese grammar for English speakers is that "AはBです" doesn't always mean "A is B."

According to the weather report, it'll be raining tomorrow.

私は癌です- I have a cancer.

彼女はどこ？ - Where is she?
彼女は台所です - She is in the kitchen.

今日は車ですか? - Are you driving today?

今日はゆううつです - I feel gloomy today.

試合は明日です - The game is to be held tomorrow.

彼女はいつも昼は弁当です - She always brings her own bento for lunch.

この文は自然です - This sentence sounds natural.

彼はもう来た? - Has he come yet?
彼はまだです - He hasn't come yet.

今日はくたくたです - I'm very tired today.

何を注文したの？- What did you order?
私はピザで、彼女はパスタです - I ordered pizza, and she ordered pasta.



This is a famous joke a lot of Japanese people who are learning English know.

Would you like beef or chicken?
 I am chicken!
("私はチキン!" is correct and sounds natural in Japanese.)
