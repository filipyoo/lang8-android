How Many Fingers Do You Have?

指 means fingers, but if you ask Japanese "あなたの指は何本ですか?," they will answer 20 because 指 is used to refer to a finger, thumb and toe. If you want to clarify that you are talking about toes, you need to say 足の指.

We call each finger:
親指 - a thumb,
人差し指 - an index finger,
中指 - a middle finger,
薬指 - a ring finger and
小指 - a little finger.

When you are talking to little kids, you can also call them:
お父さん指 - a thumb,
お母さん指 - an index finger,
お兄さん指 - a middle finger,
お姉さん指 - a ring finger and
赤ちゃん指 - a little finger.
