Using ごめん

ごめん is used to apologize.

It's also used when you don't want to do something, and it's followed by だ or です in this case.

ごめんだ is used when whether you have done something before or not. On the other hand, こりごり(懲り懲り)だ is used when you have done something, but you don't want to do it again / any more.

彼の下で働くのはもうこりごりだ。
- I don't work for him any more.
