Using かじる

かじる means to bite, gnaw or munch. Since the kanji is complicated, it's usually written in hiragana.

ネズミがチーズをかじっている。
- A mouse is gnawing cheese.


It's also used as a metaphor that means to learn something a little.

暇な時にフランス語を少しかじっている。
- I'm studying French a little when I have free time.

彼にケンカを売らないほうがいい。彼は空手を少しかじったことがあるらしい。
- Never pick a fight with him. I heard that he had learned karate a little.


You can't use it if you study something in earnest, for example, if you are studying a foreign language to become a professional translator.
