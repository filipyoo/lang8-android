Using 落とす

落とす means "to drop." 

ノートパソコンを床に落とした。
- I dropped my laptop on the floor.


You can also say 落とす when you lost something small that you usually put in your pocket, such as keys, wallet, etc.

If you explicitly say "財布を「床に」落とした," it means that "I dropped my wallet on the floor," but when you merely say that "財布を落とした," it means "I lost my wallet." If you usually put your purse in your bag and lost it, you would say "財布を失くした."


落とす is also used to describe "to remove [stains/spots]."

シャツの汚れが落ちない。
- I can't remove the stains from my shirt.


金を落とす can also be used to mean "spend money."

市長は、観光客がたくさんこの街を訪れて、たくさんお金を落とすことを望んでいる。
- The Mayer wants that a lot of tourists visit this city and spend a lot of money.


落とす is also used to describe "to lose games."
肩を落とす is an idiom which means "to be disappointed."

私はヤンキースが大事な試合を続けて落としたので、肩を落としている。
- I'm very disappointed because the Yankees lost important games in a row.

気を落とす also means "to be disappointed," but it's used in more serious situations. For example, when someone you love passed away.
