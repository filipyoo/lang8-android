How to Pass Up Someone's Invitation Casually in Japanese

When your friends invite you out for a drink and you don't want to go, after you say "ごめん" you can continue:
今日はパスする - I'll pass today.
また今度にする - I'll go next time.
今日は止めとく - I won't go today. (とく is a short version of ておく.)

They would say "わかった. じゃあまた今度ね."


If you are not so close with them and you feel hesitate to pass up it casually, you can say: 
今日は用事があるので... / 今日はちょっと都合が悪いです. - I have something to do today.
