Using たち

The difference between singular and plural in Japanese is very ambiguous. Basically, there is no distinction between them in most Japanese nouns, but there are some exceptions. When 達(たち) follows some nouns related to people, it means that the noun is plural. For example, あなた(you) is always singular and あなた達 is plural. (It's very interesting for me because although English has strict rules about the difference between singular and plural, "you" is used as both singular and plural.) 

There are also some exceptions for たち:
子どもたち is plural, but you can also use 子ども as plural.

公園で子どもたちが遊んでいる。- Children are playing in the park.
公園で子どもが遊んでいる。This sentence doesn't tell you whether the 子ども means a child or children.

友, 友人 and 友だち are used as both singular and plural.
私は友だちがたくさんいる。- I have a lot of friends.
私は友だちが一人しかいない。- I have only one friend.
The difference between them is rather the degree of formality. 友 and 友人 sounds more formal than 友だち.


When たち follows a specific person, it means "and the others."

山田さんたちが今日家に来る。
- Yamada-san and the others are coming to my house today.

お父さんたちに会うのが待ちきれない。
- I can't wait to see my dad and the others.

It's common to say たち after a specific person in the group, instead of saying ”彼ら." We rarely use a personal pronoun in a conversation.


You can't use たち for things. It's acceptable to use it for animals.
