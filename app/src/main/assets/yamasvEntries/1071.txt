Using 〜は〜

"〜は〜," such as "私はアメリカ人," is a very common structure. "AはB" sometimes means "A is B," but in many cases it doesn't. The following Japanese sentences may sound strange for elementary Japanese learners, because you can't say these sentences as "A is B." They don't have a verb, and some of them don't even have the subject too. However, Japanese people usually speak like these in a casual conversation; 


ご注文は？
私はコーヒー。
- May I ask your order?
- I'd like coffee, please.


明日はどこに行くんだっけ？
明日は渋谷。
- Where are we going to tomorrow again?
- We are going to Shibuya tomorrow.


明日は誰が料理を作る番？
明日は私。
- Whose turn to cook tomorrow?
- I'll cook tomorrow.


この料理は誰が作ったの？
サラダは私で、パスタは妹。
- Who made these dishes?
- I made the salad, and my sister made the pasta.
(Interestingly, you can also say "サラダは私で、妹はパスタ." It shows that Japanese people change the topic flexibly by using は.)


あの店で買った品物はいつ届くの？
テレビは今日。冷蔵庫は明日。
- When will they deliver our stuffs we bought in the shop?
- They'll deliver the TV today, and the refrigerator tomorrow.
(Similarly, you can also say "テレビは今日。明日は冷蔵庫。." In the first sentence, the speaker chooses a stuff as the topic, and date in the second sentences.)


これ学校に持って行っていい？
亀はだめ。
- Can I take it to school?
- You can't take your turtle to school.


- Where are my kids?
- Your son is playing baseball and your daughter is in the kitchen.
子供達はどこ？
息子は野球で、娘は台所。
(This answer implies that the son plays baseball almost every day at the same place.)
