The Difference Between 〜にくい/づらい and むずかしい

にくい/づらい is used when there is a problem with the object. On the other hand, むずかしい is used when it's not easy due to the speaker's problem.

彼の説明はわかりづらい sounds as if the speaker is saying that his explanation isn't good. If the speaker thinks that they don't have enough knowledge to understand his explanation, they would say 彼の説明を理解するのはむずかしい.
