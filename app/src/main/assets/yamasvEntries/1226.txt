Using 覚えはない

覚えはない is used when you don't remember something or you don't think that you did something.

彼はあなたのことを知ってるって言ってたけど、どこで会ったの?
彼と会った覚えはないけど....
- He said that he knew you. Where have you met?
- I don't think I have met him before....


It's also used when the listner is misunderstanding what you said/did.

なんで彼に才能がないって言ったの? 彼は落ち込んでたよ。
そんなことを言った覚えはない。もっと努力するべきだと言っただけだ。
- Why did you say to him that he wasn't gifted? He was depressed about that.
- I didn't say so. I just said that he had to work harder.
