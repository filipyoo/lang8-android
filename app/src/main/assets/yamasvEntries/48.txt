You can use の as a pronoun.

1.
You can use の when you refer something already you said.

僕の車は古いから、新しい の が欲しい - My car is too old, so I want a new one.
シャツを買いに行って、赤い の を買った = I went shopping to buy a new shirt, and I bought a red one.

2.
You can use の when you refer something you don't know.

なにかへんな の が、机の上にある - Unknown strange object is on the desk.
この赤い の は何？ - What is this red one?

Young children sometimes say like this when they don't know its name.

これ、私の の - This is mine.

3.
You can use の when you refer a person.
あの赤いシャツを着ている の は弟です - That man who is in the red shirt is my brother.
ここにいる の は弟です - This is my brother.

However, using の in order to refer a person is a little rude. You should use 方(かた) when you introduce someone.
ここにいる 方(かた)　は、山田さんです - This is Mr. Yamada.
