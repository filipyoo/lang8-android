The difference between 行く and 行ってくる.

Both 行く and 行ってくる have the same meaning that “I will go,” but each of them has a different nuance.
行ってくる is composed of 行って and くる. In Japanese, 来る means to go back to where the speaker is now. (It is different from “come” in English.)
Therefore, 行ってくる implies that you will go back here.  Similarly, くる after Te-form of verbs implies the same nuance.
For example: 
買い物に行ってくる means “I will go shopping,” and implies “I will go back here.”
彼に会ってくる means “I will go to see him,” and implies “I will go back here.”
映画を観てくる means “I will go to a movie theater to watch a movie,” and implies “I will go back here.”

If you are working for a company in America and going to go to Japan for business trip, you can say “日本に行ってくる” to your colleague because you are going to go back to America. However, if you are going to be transferred to office in Japan and not sure whether you will go back to present office or not in the future, you can’t say “日本に行ってくる,”  You should say “日本に行く” in this case.
