Using 々

々 is special kanji called 踊り字(odoriji). I can't explain how to read it by itself because it depends the character it follows. It's used when the same character is repeated twice:
嫌々(いやいや) / 渋々(しぶしぶ) - reluctantly.
度々(たびたび) - so often.
山々(やまやま) - mountains.

There are exceptions: 人々,which means "people," is read as ひとびと, not ひとひと.

It might not be incorrect to write 嫌嫌, 渋渋, 度度, 山山 or 人人, but it looks weird. You should use 々.

々 is also used in a proper noun, such as 佐々木(ささき) or 代々木(よよぎ).
