Using ごめん

ごめん is a short version of ごめんなさい, which means "I'm sorry." 

遅れてごめん。
- I'm sorry, I'm late.


As you can use すみません to mean "excuse me," you can also use ごめん to mean it in a casual conversation.

ごめん。トムはどこか知らない?
- Excuse me. Do you know where Tom is?


It's also used when you don't want to do something.

金曜日に残業するのはごめんだ。
- I don't want to work overtime on Friday.

彼の下で働くのは二度とごめんだ。
- I don't want to work for him ever again.
