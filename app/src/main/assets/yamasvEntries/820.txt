Using 〜そうにない/そうもない

そうだ can be used to describe your guesses.

雨が降りそうだ。
It looks like it's going to rain.

The opposite of it is not そうじゃない, but そうにない.

雨は降りそうにない。
It doesn't look like it's going to rain.
(In general, the particle は after the subject sounds more natural than が in a negative form.)

You can also use そうもない, which sounds as if the possibility is very low.
 
このむずかしい漢字は覚えられそうもない。
I don't think I could memorize this difficult kanji.

彼なしでは次の試合は勝てそうもない。
It's impossible to win the next game without him.
