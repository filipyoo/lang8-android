が or けど in Conversation

が or けど is often used to connect two sentences in conversation, but it doesn't always use to mean "but." They are sometimes used to merely connect two sentences.

昨日映画を見たけど、おもしろかった。
I watched a movie yesterday. It was very fun.

買い物に行くけど、何か買ってきてほしいものある?
I'll go shopping. Do you have anything you want me to buy?

もうお昼だけど、良いレストラン知らない?
It's almost noon. Do you know any nice restaurant?

相談したいことがあるんですが、午後は空いてますか?
I’ve got to talk to you. Do you have time this afternoon?


Of course, it's not incorrect to say "昨日映画を見た. おもしろかった." However, it sounds unnatural to say related two short sentences separately.
