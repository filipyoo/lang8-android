How to Say "For your information" in Japanese

If you want to say "for your information" merely to add information, you can say ちなみに or 参考までに.

ちなみにあの子は私の妹です。
- For your information, that girl is my little sister.
(This Japanese sentence doesn't imply anything.)


If you want to say it ironically, you can say "言っておくけど" or "忠告しておくけど."

忠告しておくが、あの子は俺の妹だ。もし彼女をいじめたら殺す。
- For your information, that girl is my little sister. If you bully her, I'll kill you.

言っておくけど、私の家はホテルじゃないから。いつでも好きな時に泊まれると思わないで。
- For your information, my house isn't a hotel. Don't think that you can stay here anytime you want.
