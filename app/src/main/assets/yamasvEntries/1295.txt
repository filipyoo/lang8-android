Using なんなりと

何なりと is a very polite version of なんでも, which means "anything." It's used when you are talking with a very important person. You can write in both hiragana and kanji, but you can't pronounce it as なになりと.

質問があれば、何なりとお聞きください。
- Please let me know anything if you have a question.

この部屋にあるものはなんなりとお使いください。
- You can use anything you want in this room.


You can also use it by itself.

お願いがあるんだけど。
なんなりと。
- Can I ask you a favor?
- I'll do anything I can.


It sounds unnatural in a casual conversation. It sounds as if you are a butler.
