Confusing Answers はい / いいえ

When someone asks you yes-no questions in negative form in Japanese, you can't answer yes or no in the same way in English.

Are you a student? - あなたは学生ですか.
Yes, I am. - はい、学生です。
No, I'm not. - いいえ、違います。

Aren't you a student? - あなたは学生じゃないのですか?
Yes, I am - いいえ、学生です。 -  (1)
No, I'm not. - はい / いいえ、違います。- (2)

(1) 
The answer はい or いいえ for this yes-no question doesn't depend on whether you are a student or not, but depends on how they ask. Therefore, you have to answer いいえ if you are a student in this case. "はい、学生です" sounds weird as an answer for the question.

(2)
Similarly, you can answer はい if you aren't a student. However, you can also say "いいえ、違います."


If your girlfriend said "I'm not beautiful," you shouldn't say "はい," It means "you aren't beautiful" in this case. You should say "いや、違う," it means "you are beautiful."



Similarly, も is also confusing when it follows negative form.

A: 私は学生です - I'm a student.
B: 私も. - Me too. (I'm a student too.)
C: 私は学生じゃないです - I'm not a student.
D: 私も. - Me neither. (I'm not a student too.)
