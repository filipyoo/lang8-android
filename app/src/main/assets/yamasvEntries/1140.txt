Using 〜のこと?

"〜のこと?" means "Do you mean 〜?," which is used when you guess the correct word the listener are misunderstanding or they forgot.

しびやに行ったことはある？

ポケモンのこと？
- What's your favorite anime?
- When I was a child, I was into.... I can't remember the name. The one a cute yellow monster appears.
- Do you mean "Pokemon?" 



のこと is also used to refer a person.

彼のことが嫌い。
- I don't like him.
(You can't say like this for things. For example, you can't say りんごのことが嫌い to mean that you don't like apples. It sounds as if you are talking about a person named りんご.)

- Do you love me?

彼のことはよく知らない。
- I don't know him well.
