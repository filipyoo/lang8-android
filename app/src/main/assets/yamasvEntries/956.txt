How Do You Say "Consider it done" in Japanese

When someone asks you something, you can say お安い御用です to mean "Consider it done."  お安い御用 implies that the task is very easy for you. It may sounds a little comically. You should say 承知しました or お任せください in a formal situation and when the listner is an upper class person.
任せといて sounds natural in a casual conversation.
