I found a question about Japanese language in Lang-8. The question is the difference of  
"ついに" and "やっと." I will try to explain it in English. 

"ついに"  and "やっと" mean "finally/at last." 

We use "ついに"  when we achieved our goal spending a long time. The goal was really valuable for us and we must feel deep satisfaction.
"やっと" sometimes used  in the same situation. However, "やっと" is mainly used when you finished boring or valueless job.
Therefore, we say "やっと後片付けが終わった", but we don't say "ついに後片付けが終わった."
(Of course, if you are very tidy and always clean the room with passion, you can say the latter.)

If you say "ついに論文を書き終えた", we feel that you had been studying for a long time with passion.
If you say "やっと論文を書き終えた", we might think that your goal was not the paper but just obtaining credits.

We also use "やっと"  when we are released from something awful. "やっと客が帰った" implies that you don't like them or you have some plans after they leave.
