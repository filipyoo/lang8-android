"〜じゃない？"

"〜じゃない？" is used to describe your guesses in casual conversations. In my opinion, it's used when you don't have 100% confidence but have over about 60-70% one.

誰が私のチョコレートを食べたの? / 彼じゃない?
Who ate my chocolate? / I think he did.

この試合、どっちが勝つと思う? / 日本じゃない?
Which do you think will win this game? / I think Japan will.

When "じゃない?" follows verbs, "ん" is added between them.

彼はまだ来てないの？ / パーティのこと忘れてるんじゃない?
Hadn't he come yet? / He may have forgotten this party.

お父さんはどこ? / 2階でテレビを見てるんじゃない?
Where is dad? / He must be watching TV upstairs.

コンピュータにログインできない! / パスワードが間違ってるんじゃない?
I can't log in to this computer! / Are you sure you entered a correct password?

ここはどこ? / 道を間違えたんじゃない?
I have no idea where we are. / We must have chosen the wrong way.
