The difference between "帰る" and "戻る."

"帰る" means that we go back to our home. In this case, the meaning of home is not "where we live" but "our mental base." "故郷に帰る" means that we go back to our hometown. The "故郷" is the place which you spent in your childhood and which your parents live. Since "故郷" is our mental base, we say "故郷に帰る" even if we are going to stay there only one night.
On the other hand, we say "事務所に戻る" in case of going back to an office from their lunch. We say "ホテルに戻る" in case of going back to a hotel. However, if we don't have our house and we live in a hotel, we would say "ホテルに帰る."
If a man keeps a mistress and he loves her than his wife, he might say "家に戻る" to his mistress.

There is another case we use "帰る." "客が帰る" means that a guest leaves our house. It doesn't matter wherever they go.
