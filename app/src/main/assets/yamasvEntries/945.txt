How Do You Say "that" in Japanese

It depends whether "that" is close to the listener or not.

"Is that car yours?"

If the car is close to the listener, you should say "それは君の車?" If the car is far from both you and the listener, you should say "あれは君の車?"


A similar rule can be applied for what you can't see.

"I can't believe that story."
If the listener told you the story, you should say "その話は信じられない." If someone else told you, you should say "あの話は信じられない."

ケンは格闘技の達人だよ。空手と柔道の黒帯を持っている。
"Ken is a master of martial arts. He has black belts in Karate and Judo."
"Is the guy Japanese?"
If you don't know who he is, you'd say "その人は日本人?" If you do, you'd say "あの人は日本人?"

今日はJFKが殺された日です。
"Today is the anniversary of JFK's death."
"Where were you on that day?"
If you weren't born on the day or you don't remember the day, you'd say "その日はどこにいた?" If you remember the day clearly, you'd say "あの日はどこにいた?"
