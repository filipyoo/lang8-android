The Confusing Usage of も

Since a title of a newspaper article has to be short enough, there are a lot of titles which are hard for Japanese learners to understand the meanings.

1.
"本田欠場も首位CSKAは勝利" 
This is a title of a football news site(<a href="http://soccer.skyperfectv.co.jp/international/5227" target="_blank">http://soccer.skyperfectv.co.jp/international/5227</a>). This も is used to mean "although." This Japanese title means "Although Honda didn't play, CSKA won the game.

Here are some examples using も to mean "although." も can follow both nouns and the u-form of verbs in this case.

殺人の容疑者が海外に逃げようと試みるも、空港で捕まった。
Although the murder suspect tried to run away to abroad, he was caught at the airport.

最後に３ポイントシュートを狙うも、失敗した。　
He tried 3-point shot at the last second, but failed.

思い切って彼女に告白するも、彼女は笑って相手にしなかった。
I found courage to tell her "I love you," but she dismissed it with a laugh.

Although all of the above three sentences describe a past event, you don't have to use past tense for verbs before も.


2. 
”本田怪我、次の試合は欠場も"
Other expressions using も like this are also often used as a title of articles. This も is a short form of "もあり得る/もあるかもしれない." This Japanese sentence means "Honda was injured, so he might not play in the next game." I think you can see this usage of も only in titles of articles.

"スタジアムの建設遅れる。オリンピックの日程に影響も。"
Studium construction is delayed. It may have an effect on the Olympic game schedule.
