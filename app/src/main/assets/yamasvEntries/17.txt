A) 昨日、学校に行く前に、朝ごはんを食べた
I ate breakfast before I went to school yesterday.

B) 明日、朝ごはんを食べた後に、学校に行く
I will go to school after eating breakfast tomorrow.

Although both of the above sentences are very natural for Japanese People, some English speakers may feel strange. 

In A, you speak about the past but 行く is not past tense. However, "昨日、学校に行った前に、朝ごはんを食べた" is unnatural.

At B, you speak about the future but 食べた is past tense. However, "明日、朝ごはんを食べる後に、学校に行く" is unnatural.


The predicate of A is 食べた and the time when you went to school is later than the time when you ate breakfast, therefore you can't conjugate 行く into past tense.
If you ate breakfast at school, you have to conjugate 行く into past tense, and say "昨日、学校に行った後に、朝ごはんを食べた."

The predicate of B is 行く and the time when you will eat breakfast is earlier than the time you will go to school, therefore you have to conjugate 食べる into past tense.
If you will eat breakfast at school , you can't have to conjugate 食べる into past tense , and you can say "明日、朝ごはんを食べる前に、学校に行く."
