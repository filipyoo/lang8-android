Using 決まって

決まって means "always." It can modify a verb.

私がゴルフをすると決まって雨が降る。
- It always be raining when I play golf.

新しい若い秘書の話をすると、妻は決まって機嫌が悪くなる。
- My wife is in a bad mood whenever I talk about my new young secretary.

高いワインを買うと決まって彼が家に遊びに来る。
- He always visits my home when I buy expensive wine.


〜に限って is a similar phrase to 決まって, but there is a slight difference. "ゴルフをする時に限って雨が降る" implies that it's not raining when I don't play golf. On the other hand, "ゴルフをすると決まって" doesn't refer the other days. Similarly, the third example sentence can be used if he visits so often even when I don't buy expensive wine, but "高いワインを買った時に限って" implies that he doesn't visit my house when I don't buy expensive one.
