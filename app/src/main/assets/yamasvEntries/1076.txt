The Difference Between 生活, 人生 and 命

There are a lot of Japanese words which means "life:" 生活, 人生, 命, etc.

生活 means day-to-day activities or living, such as eating, sleeping, watching TV, etc.

人生 means life from birth to death. If you say "良い人生を送りたい," it implies, for example, you want to study in a good school, get a good job, get married someone nice, and have lovely children. On the other hand, if you say "良い生活を送りたい," it implies you want to eat better food or wear better clothes. (Of course, the definition of "良い人生/生活" is different for each person.)

今日は人生で一番幸せな日だ。
- Today is the happiest day in my life.

人生は一度きり。
- You can't live your life twice.


命 is something you lose when you die. The life is the most important thing for everyone, so we often use "命の次に大切" for the most important thing.

- This is the second most important thing next to my life.


"命を落とす" means "to lose your life" or "to die."

- If you said something about me to the police, I'd kill you.
