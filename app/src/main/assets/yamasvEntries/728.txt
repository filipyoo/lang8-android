Word Order In Japanese Sentence

Unlike English, the word order in Japanese sentence is very flexible because particles help you to understand the meaning rather than the word order.
All the following Japanese sentences are correct. I can't choose the best one to mean "I gave him chocolate."

私は彼にチョコをあげました。
私はチョコを彼にあげました。
彼に私はチョコをあげました。
彼にチョコを私はあげました。
チョコを私は彼にあげました。
チョコを彼に私はあげました。

Therefore, you don't need to think carefully about the word order as long as you choose the right particle.

Even "彼にチョコをあげました、私は。" is correct if you want to stress "私は." Similarly, "私は彼にあげました、チョコを。" or "私はチョコをあげました、彼に。" is correct in some situations. Especially, they are often used when the speaker is excited.

However, we sometimes pay attention to the word order in order to avoid misunderstanding. 
私は彼と彼女の家に行きました。
This Japanese sentence is tricky. You can understand this sentence in two ways:
"He and I went to her house." and
"I went to his house and also to her house."

If you mean the former, you can avoid misunderstanding by saying "彼と私は彼女の家に行きました." If you mean the latter, you should say ”私は彼の家と彼女の家に行きました."
