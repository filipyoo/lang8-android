How should Japanese learner learn kanji?

I received a message which asks for my advice. The sender want to start learn Kanji but have no idea where to start. I tried to teach but I couldn't, because I don't remember how I had learned kanji. Therefore, I decided to ask you. Many of you, who are Japanese learner, learn kanji now and can use it more or less. Could you tell me how you learn kanji? If you have any advice to whom start to learn kanji, please leave a comment here. Do you know any useful site on the net? Thank you.
