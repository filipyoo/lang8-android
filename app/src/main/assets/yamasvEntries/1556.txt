Using ばかりに

ばかりに follows the ta-form of a verb to describe a reason of a bad result. It's similar with せいで, but ばかりに is used to stress the reason and implies that you didn't make any mistake except the one.

彼の言うことを信じたばかりに大金を失った。
- Believing what he said, I lost a lot of money.

裕福な家に生まれたばかりに、彼が自分の力で成功したとは誰も思わない。
- Nobody thinks that he succeeded by himself because he was born in a rich family.

道が混んでいたばかりに大事な打ち合わせに遅れて客を失った。
- I was late for important meeting  because the load was busy and I lost a client.

嘘をついたばかりに彼女に振られた。
- She dumped me just because I lied.

You can also say ばっかりに instead; it sounds more casual.
