How to Say "You must be Tanaka-san." in Japanese

If you'll meet Mr. Tanaka for the first time, you would say "あの人が田中さんに違いない" to mean "He must be Tanaka-san" to your colleague when you find him from some distance. However, to say "田中さんに違いない" to him to mean "You must be Tanaka-san" sounds very weird. You should say "田中さんですね." 
If you're not sure if he is Tanaka-san, you can say "田中さんですか?"
