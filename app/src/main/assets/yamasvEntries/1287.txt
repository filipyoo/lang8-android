Using いろいろあって

いろいろあって means "for a number of reasons." It's used when you can't describe  the reasons because it's very complicated, or you don't want to explain them.

いろいろあって仕事を辞めることにしました。
- I've decided to quit my job for a number of reasons.


You can also say it by itself when someone asks reasons.

なんで仕事辞めるの?
いろいろあって。
- Why you quit your job?
- It's a long story.

If someone answers like this, you shouldn't ask any more unless they start telling you the reasons voluntarily.
