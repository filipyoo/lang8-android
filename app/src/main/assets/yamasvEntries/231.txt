The Very Convenient Japanese Phrase 自分で

I made it by myself.
"それは私自身で作りました" is a technically correct sentence. However, it sounds very unnatural for us. You should say "それは自分で作りました."

"自分で" is a very convenient phrase. You can use it no matter  who is the subject.

それは、母が 自分で 作りました - My mother made it by herself.
それは、トムが 自分で 作りました - Tom made it by himself.
それは、自分で 作ったの? - Did you make it by yourself?


You have to use 自分たちで when the subject is plural. This is one of the rare rules where you have to be aware of the difference between the singular and the plural in Japanese.

それは、彼らが自分たちで作りました - They made it by themselves.
