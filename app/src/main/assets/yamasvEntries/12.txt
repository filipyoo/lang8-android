I will explain some misleading Japanese expressions.

すみません:
Many of you already know about this , this is famous as a representative Japanese misleading expression. 
This has three meanings, "Excuse me", "Thank you", and "Sorry."

ごめんなさい:
This is a word which represents apology but some Japanese people use this instead of "Excuse me." If someone suddenly says so to you,  what they wanted to say is "Excuse me."

悪いね
If you help someone, they may say "悪いね" to you. It doesn't mean that "You are bad."
They use it as an appreciative word.

大きなお世話
You may think this is a positive expression because 世話 means care/help. However 大きなお世話 has the opposite meaning. "大きなお世話だ!" means "It's none of your business!/Mind your own business."

おかしい
おかしい has two meanings, "strange" and "funny." 

おもしろい
おもしろい also has two meanings, "interesting" and "funny.  "なかなかおもしろいことを言うじゃないか" is one of a common serif in Japanese drama or anime. It can read two separate meanings, "It's very interesting" and "Nonsense!"

どうも
When "ありがとう" or "すみません" is followed after "どうも", "どうも" is used to emphasize next expression.
When it is used alone, this word has a lot of meanings, interestingly I can say it has no meanings. I suggest to you that do not try to understand this word exactly. When someone says "どうも" to you , all you have to do is just saying "どうも" without thinking anything.
