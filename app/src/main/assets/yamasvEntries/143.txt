The difference between 〜たい and 〜てみたい.

〜てみる means to try.

ボタンを押してみる。- I try to push the button.
寿司を食べてみる。- I try sushi.

Therefore, 〜てみたい means "want to try."

寿司を食べてみたい。- I would like to try sushi.

Since "〜てみたい" implies that you had never done it, "また、日本に行ってみたい (I would like to go to Japan again)" sounds a little bit unnatural to me.
 "また、日本に行きたい" sounds more natural if you have ever been to Japan.
 Similarly, "日本に行ってみたい" sounds more natural than "日本に行きたい" to me if you have never been to Japan.
