The Usage of は to Mean "at least."

When は comes after the number with the unit and it is followed by a positive sentence, it means "at least."

3時間 は ここにいる。
- We have been here for at least three hours.
You can also say "少なくとも3時間はここにいる," but the nuance doesn't change even if you omit "少なくとも."

5回 は 日本に行ったことがある。
- I've been to Japan before at least five times.

10年 は その会社で働いている。
I've worked for that company for at least ten years.


On the other hand, when a negative sentence comes after は, it means that the number doesn't reach a specific number.

3時間 は ここにいない。
- We are being here for a long time, but it's less than three hours.

5回 は 日本に行ったことがない。
- I've been to Japan a few times before, but it's less than five times.

10年 は その会社で働いていない。
- I've worked for that company for many years, but it doesn't reach to ten years.
