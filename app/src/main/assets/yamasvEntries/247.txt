タ-form of Verbs

タ-form of Verbs is usually used to describe past events.

昨日、日本語を勉強しました - I studied Japanese yesterday. 
先週、彼女に会いました - I met her last week.


タ-form of Verbs is also used when you discover or re-realize something.

If you are looking for your key, you should say "鍵があった" when you discover it. "鍵がある" sounds very strange in this case. "鍵がある" means that you don't look for it and you happen to notice that the key is there.

"あなたの名前は何ですか? (What is your name?)" is used when you don't know the listener's name. "あなたの名前は何でしたか?" is used when you forget his name.


"明日は、英語のテストだ"  means "I'll have an English test tomorrow." On the other hand, "明日は、英語のテストだった" means the speaker has forgotten that he will have the test tomorrow and he suddenly remember that.

In case of describing your re-realization of actions, "のだった" is used. "明日は、彼の家に行くのだった" means the speaker suddenly remembers that the speaker is going to visit his house tomorrow. ( "んだった" is often used instead of "のだった" in casual conversation.)
