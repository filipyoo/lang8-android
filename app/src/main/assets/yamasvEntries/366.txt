"〜だ" Sounds Unnatural

"〜だ" is the casual form of "〜です." It's correct. However, we don't usually end sentence with だ in casual conversation. (Some older men may use "〜だ" when they speak to younger people.)

That is my house.
? あれが私の家だ。 (Sounds unnatural.)
o あれが私の家。

I'm from Canada.
? 私の出身はカナダだ。(Sounds unnatural.)
o 私の出身はカナダ。


"〜だ" is mainly used when you are surprised or your are excited.

Look! Big bear! 
見て! 大きい熊だ!

I got it! He is the real culprit! 
わかった! 彼が真犯人だ!


"〜か？" in a question form also sounds unnatural. You don't have to add anything in question form in casual conversation. All you have to do is to use rising intonation. Some people, especially women, add の. It might sound a little bit childish.

Did you finish your lunch?
x もう昼食は食べたか? (Sounds unnatural.)
o もう昼食は食べた?
o もう昼食は食べたの?

Will you go to school today?
x 今日、学校に行くか? (Sounds unnatural.)
o 今日、学校に行く? 
o 今日、学校に行くの? 


"〜のか?" is technically correct, but it sounds bossy.
