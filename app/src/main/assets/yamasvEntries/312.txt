How to say "for a long time" in Japanese

"長い間" and "長いこと" are popular expression to mean "for a long time." They can be used with both positive and negative forms.

長い間、東京に住んでいます.
長いこと、東京に住んでいます.
I live in Tokyo for a long time.

長い間、彼に会っていません.
長いこと、彼に会っていません.
I've not seen him for a long time.


"久しく" is also used to mean "for a long time." It's a little old-fashioned expression. "久しい" is an adjective which means "long time has passed."

久しく、その俳優をテレビで見ていない.
その俳優をテレビで見なくなって久しい.
I've not seen the actor on TV for ages.

久しく、東京に行っていない.
最後に東京を訪れてから久しい.
I've not visited Tokyo for ages.

"しばらく" is also used to mean "for a long time," but it can be used to mean "for a short time."

しばらく彼に会っていない.
I've not seen him for a long time.

しばらく彼をここで待ってる.
I'll wait for him here for a short time.


You can use "久しぶりに" or "しばらくぶりに" to mean "for the first time in a while. 
ひさしぶりに昨日寿司を食べた.
しばらくぶりに昨日寿司を食べた.
I ate sushi yesterday for the first time in a while.

I think "ひさしぶり" and "しばらくぶり" are na-adjectives, but you should say "久しぶりの" and "しばらくぶりの" when they modify nouns. ("久しぶりな" and "しばらくぶりな" sound weird.)

香川のゴールを見たのは久しぶりだ.
香川のゴールを見たのはしばらくぶりだ.
久しぶりの香川のゴールを見た.
しばらくぶりの香川のゴールを見た.
I saw Kagawa make a goal for the first time in a long time.
