Usage of 聞く

聞く and 聴く have the same pronunciation. 聴く is mainly used when you listen to music or someone's talk intentionally or carefully. However, the difference between them is ambiguous. Some Japanese people don't  pay much attention to it and use 聞く in many cases.

聞く is basically used to mean "to hear." When you heard someone's voice from the next room, 聞こえた sounds more natural than 聞いた. If you say "隣の部屋の声を聞いた," it sounds as if you listened to someone's talk intentionally. You should say "隣の部屋の声が聞こえた," when you happened to hear the voice.


"Sound" is translated as "聞こえる" too.

Your expression sounds as if you blame to me. - あなたの言い方は私を批判しているように聞こえる。

This sentence sounds too lengthy. - この文章は長ったらしく聞こえる。


聞く is also used to mean "to ask." Although 尋ねる has the meaning of "to ask" too, 聞く is a more common expression to say "to ask" in casual conversation.

弟にこの漢字の読み方を聞いたけど、知らなかった。
I asked my brother how to read this kanji, but he didn't know it.

パーティに来るかどうか、彼に聞いておくよ。
I'll ask him whether he'll come to the party or not.


言うことを聞かない is used when someone refuses to pay attention to what you say.

娘が私の言うことを聞かない。
My daughter refuses to pay attention to what I say. / My daughter doesn't listen to what I say. 

彼らは上司の言うことを聞かなかった - They ignored their boss.

You can use "言うことを聞かない" when something doesn't work well. When your PC mouse doesn't work well, you can say "マウスが言うことを聞かない."
