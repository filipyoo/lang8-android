How to Say "Guess what" in Japanese

"ねぇ聞いて" or "ちょっと聞いて" are common phrases to mean "Guess what." (They  are also used, when someone doesn't listen to you, to mean "Listen to me!")

When you have news and you are sure that the listener will be interested in it, you can say "いいこと教えてあげようか?" Some men might say "やろうか?" instead of "あげようか?"
