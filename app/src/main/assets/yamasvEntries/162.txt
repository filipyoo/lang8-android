The special usage of が and しかし.

が and しかし means "but; however,"  

彼は数学が得意だ が、英語は苦手だ。
彼は数学が得意だ。しかし、英語は苦手だ。
He is good at math, but is not good at English.


However, there are other special usages. I would like to share them with you.

You can use が when you start a sentence or conversation. We like this usage very much. You will be confused if you read these が as "but."

質問があるんです が、これはなんですか？
I have a question; what is this?

新聞で読んだんです が、松井が引退するらしいです。
According a newspaper I read, Matui is going to retire.

日本に行くんです が、何か買ってきてほしいものはありますか？
I'm going to Japan; do you have anything you want me to buy?


You can use しかし to stress your surprise. You can use it in both positive and negative situations. It has no specific meanings or nuances; it is used to just stress your surprise.

しかし　この料理はおいしいね。
This dish tastes really delicious.

しかし　この料理はまずいね。
This dish tastes awful.


You can use それにしても instead of しかし in this case.
それにしても、この料理は美味しいね。
それにしても、この料理はまずいね。

それ is usually used as a pronoun in Japanese sentence, but それ in the above sentences refer to nothing; それにしても is used to just stress your surprise.
