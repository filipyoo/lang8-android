Internet Resources for Japanese Learners

The number of internet resources for Japanese learners may not as many as that for English learners. However, those for Japanese people who are studying English are also useful for Japanese learners because they have both English and Japanese sentences. Furthermore, reading Japanese explanations helps you learn Japanese a lot and it's easier than reading articles that are all written in Japanese. I'd like to share some blogs I subscribe; I think they are also helpful for  Japanese learners.

The author of the blog is a bilingual. He introduces casual English expressions. It means that he also introduces casual Japanese expressions at the same time. He often updates the blog and the design is nice too.
He also has a YouTube channel.

(Of course, his Japanese pronunciation is perfect.)

He wrote that he couldn't speak Japanese well until he came to Japan, but I can't believe it. He writes perfect Japanese.
He doesn't seem to update the blog very often.

This blog introduces casual expressions from a famous TV show, Friends. There are a lot of Japanese sentences with English translations. The author may be a professional translator.


Some Japanese sentences in textbooks or on web sites sound unnatural for native speakers; some of them are technically correct, but we don't say like those. 
I guarantee that all the Japanese sentences in these blogs I share today sound lively.
