Using 〜ていない and 〜なかった

Both ていない and なかった are used to mean "did not."

昨夜はよく寝むれていない。
昨夜はよく寝むれなかった。
- I couldn't sleep well last night.

However, they are not always interchangeable. なかった sounds as if you were supposed to do it.

Did you steal my wallet? - 僕の財布を盗んだ? 
No, I didn't. - 盗んでない。
(If you say 盗まなかった, it sounds as if you had a plan to steal.)

Did you see the final match on TV last night? - 昨夜の決勝戦テレビで見た?
If you were going to watch the match, but you couldn't, you should say 見なかった. If you didn't know about the match, 見ていない sounds natural.

昨日、彼に会うつもりだったけど、会えなかった。
- I was going to see him yesterday, but I couldn't.
You can omit "会うつもりだったけど" because 会えなかった implies it.
