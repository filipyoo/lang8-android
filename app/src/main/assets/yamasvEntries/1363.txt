Omitting a Noun

When you are talking about a possession, you can omit the noun you're talking about if it's clear.

これは誰の車。
私の(車)です。
- Whose car is this?
- It's mine.
You can omit the 車 in the answer, but can't omit the の before it. I'm not saying that not omitting the 車 makes the answer unnatural; "私の車です" also sounds natural.

私の車が故障したので、弟のを使った。
- I used my brother's car because mine broke down.


〜の can be used to indicate where something is made in. For example, "日本の車" means "a car made in Japan." You can omit a noun in this case too.

ほとんどの日本の車は、アメリカのより小さい。
- Most cars made in Japan are smaller than those made in America.

日本のスイーツは好きですか？
はい、日本のは甘すぎなくて好きです。
- Do you like Japanese sweets?
- Yes. I like them because they aren't too sweet.
