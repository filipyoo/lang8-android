How Do You Say "in the last year" in Japanese

去年/昨年 means "last year." この一年 means "in the last year."

去年、東京に行った。
- Last year, I went to Tokyo.

この一年で東京に三回行った。
- In the last year, I've been to Tokyo three times.

It's July 3rd, 2015 today. Therefore, "去年、東京に行った" means that you went to Tokyo in 2014. On the other hand, "この一年" refers the period from July 4th, 2014 to Today. It's not a strict rule, so the period can include some day in June 2014. 

Of course, this rule can be applied for "in the last month, week, etc."

この3日間、何も食べていない。
- I haven't eaten anything in the last three days.

この1ヶ月、日本語だけを勉強してきた。
- In the last month, I have studied nothing but Japanese.

これはこの10年で最も重大な発見だ。
- This is the most important discovery in the last decade.
