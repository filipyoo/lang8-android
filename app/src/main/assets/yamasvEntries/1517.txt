Using やつ

You can use やつ as a pronoun in a casual conversation.

あの赤いやつ。
- Which car is yours?
- That red one.

You can write it as 奴 when you use it to refer to a man.

You can use 奴 without an adjective, but It sounds very rude. It's used when you refer to a person you hate.

- He's the worst candidate ever.

奴とだけは一緒に働きたくない。
- He's the last person I want to work with.
