The Difference Between 上手 and 得意, and Between 下手 and 苦手

When you are talking about yourself, 上手 sounds strange. You should use 得意.
o 私は料理が得意です - I'm good at cooking.
? 私は料理が上手です

得意 is mainly used to describe the ability. On the other hand, 上手 is mainly used to describe the work. When you see someone's painting and praise him, "絵が上手ですね" sounds more natural than "絵が得意ですね." When you eat someone's homemade meal and praise him, "料理が上手ですね" sounds more natural than "料理が得意ですね."

得意 and 上手 have the nuance that you are good at something for an amateur. Therefore it's rude to use 得意 or 上手 for a professional person. You shouldn't say "料理が上手ですね" to a professional chef or "彼はサッカーが得意だ" to a professional soccer player. However, it's okay to refer to specific play:
彼はドリブルが上手い - He is good at dribbling.
彼はヘディングが得意だ - He is good at heading.

If you are an English native speaker, it sounds strange to say "私は英語が得意です." You should say "私は英語を話します." 




Since 下手 is a ruder expression than 苦手, many people prefer to use 苦手 than 下手 when introducing someone. You can use 下手 when introducing yourself.

苦手 is also used to describe food or animals you hate.
私は生の魚が苦手です - I don't like raw fish. / I hate raw fish.
私は蛇が苦手です - I don't like snakes. / I hate snakes.

When someone recommends you a dish you hate, "苦手です" sounds less rude than "嫌いです." 

You can't use 下手 instead of 苦手 in this case.
x 私は生の魚が下手です
x 私は蛇が下手です 



苦手 is also used for people. It means not "hate" but "incompatible" in this case.
私はあの先生が苦手です - I have bad chemistry with that teacher.
