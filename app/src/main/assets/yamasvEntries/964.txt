Using 伺う(うかがう)

伺う is a polite version of 聞く that means "to ask a question."

お名前を伺ってもよろしいですか?
- May I ask your name?

先生はいつ戻ってきますか？
伺ってません。
- When the doctor will return?
- I don't know. (I didn't ask that.)


It's also used to mean "to come" or "to visit." It's mainly used to mean to come to the listener's place, so you don't need to say あなたの家 or あなたの場所 explicitly in the case. 

すぐ伺います。
- I'll be there soon.

明日お伺いしてもいいですか？
- Can I come to your place tomorrow?

Of course, you can mention the place explicitly if you want to.

明日事務所に伺います。
- I'll visit your office tomorrow.
