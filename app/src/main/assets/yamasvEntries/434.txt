Omitting Pronouns in Japanese Sentences

"You must know who Ken is. He was arrested."
In the second sentence, the personal pronouns "he" is used because it's clear that "he" means Ken. When you speak these sentences in Japanese, you can omit "彼は":
"ケンって知ってるでしょ？ 逮捕されたの。”
No Japanese person would be confused that who was arrested. Most Japanese people wouldn't say "ケンって知ってるでしょ？ ケン/彼 が逮捕されたの.”

In many cases where you use pronouns, you can omit the pronoun itself. I'd omit the phrases in parentheses in the following sentences.

A new employee is supposed to join us tomorrow. I heard that he can speak both English and Japanese.
- 新しい社員が明日来る。（彼は）日本語も英語も話せるらしい。

I happened to see your students and talked with them a little. They say that you are a good teacher.
- (私は)あなたの生徒とたまたま会って少し話したの。（彼らはあなたのことを）いい先生だって言ってたよ。

I bought a new car. It's not expensive but it's really good for me.
- 新車を買ったんだ。(それは）高くなかったけどすごくいいよ。

Ken is a big fan of manga and eager to become a manga writer. That's why he had decided to move to Japan.
- ケンは漫画の大ファンで漫画家になりたがっている。だから（彼は）日本に行こうと決心した。



He told me that he loves me.
This English sentence has four pronouns. Most Japanese people would say "彼に好きって言われた." If you say "彼は、私に、彼は私が好きだって言った," many Japanese people would be confused and need much time to understand what you mean. 

I told him that I love him. - 彼に好きって言った。
He told me that I was stupid. - 彼に馬鹿って言われた。
My mother asked me to teach her Japanese. - お母さんに日本語を教えてと頼まれた。

If you'd like to make a natural Japanese sentence, it's important to omit unnecessary  information.
