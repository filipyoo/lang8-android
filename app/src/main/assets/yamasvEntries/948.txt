Using 直す

直す means to fix.

彼は車を直すのが得意だ。
- He's good at fixing cars.

直す is mainly used to mean to repair things, so it sounds unnatural to say "関係を直す" / "問題を直す". You should say "関係を修復する" / "問題を解決する" to mean "to fix the relationship" / "to fix the problem."


直す can also follow the masu stem of other verbs to mean "to re..." or "to do something again."

間違ってレポートを削除してしまったので、書き直さないといけない。
- I have to rewrite the report because I deleted it by mistake.

昨日先生に送ったレポートを今日読み直していたら、たくさんの間違いに気づいた。
- When I read my report again today, which I sent to my teacher yesterday,  I found a lot of mistakes in it.

高校の時に日本語を習ったけどほとんど忘れた。勉強し直さないといけない。
- I've learned Japanese in my high school, but I forgot most of them. I need to study it again.

後でかけ直します。
- I'll call back later.


"勉強し直す" and "また勉強する" have a slightly different nuance. The former implies that you study what you have learned before again. The latter implies that you study what you haven't learned.
