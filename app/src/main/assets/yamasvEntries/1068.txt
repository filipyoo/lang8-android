The Difference between たら and て

たら is mainly used as a conditional conjunction.

これを飲んだら死ぬ。
- If you drink this, you will die.


たら can be used to describe two past consecutive events.

起きたら、ベンチに寝ていた。
- I woke up to find myself lying on a bench.

て can be also used to describe two past consecutive events.

起きて、歯を磨いた。
- I woke up and brush my teeth.


The たら and て are not interchangeable.

"I went to the park, where I saw him."
This English sentence can be translated as:
その公園に行ったら、彼と会った。and
その公園に行って、彼と会った。
The two Japanese sentences describe different situations. If you use たら, it implies that you didn't expect the action which follows たら, so the first Japanese sentence means "I went to the park, and there I ran into him." The second Japanese sentence means "I went to the park in order to see him."


"I asked him how to read this kanji, and he taught me."

その漢字の読み方を彼に聞いたら教えてくれた。
This sentence implies that you weren't sure that whether he knew it or not.

その漢字の読み方を彼に聞いて教えてもらった。
This sentence implies that you were sure that he knew it.


今日あったことを彼に話したら笑われたから頭にきた。
- I'm upset because he laughed at me when I told him what had happened today.

今日あったことを彼に話して笑わせた。
- I told him what had happened today in order to make him laugh. 


日本に行ったら、桜が咲いていた。
- I went to Japan, where I unexpectedly saw the cherry blossoms.

日本に行って桜を見てきた。（桜を見るために日本に行った。）
- I went to Japan in order to see the cherry blossoms.



I have a question. If you say "I went there to see him," does it imply that you had known that he was there? Or you can say like that even when you ran into him?
