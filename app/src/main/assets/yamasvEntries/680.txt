Using それほど/そんなに〜ない

それほど/そんなに〜ない is used to negate "very." それほど sounds more formal than そんなに.

"この店の料理はそれほどおいしくない" sounds as if "the dishes in this restaurant are better than other ordinary restaurants, but aren't delicious," or "they are not bad, but I don't want to pay a lot of money for them." If you say "この店の料理は'あまり'おいしくない," it sounds as if "they are not good."


テストはそれほどむずかしくなかった。
- The exam wasn't very difficult. 
テストはあまりむずかしくなかった。
- The exam wasn't difficult. / The exam was easy.

(すごくむずかしくなかった sounds unnatural. You shouldn't use すごく or とても with a negative form.)


メッシはヘディングはそれほどうまくない。
- Messi isn't very good at heading.
(Of course, his heading must be better than amateur players, but this Japanese sentence implies that it is not very good for a professional soccer player.)
