The relation between a predicate of the sentence and は/が.

Only nouns, verbs, and adjectives can become a predicate in most Japanese sentence,. Therefore, most Japanese sentences can be categorized into three types by their predicate's type.

Basically, は follows the subject in the sentences whose predicate is a noun or an adjective. (Since it is difficult in the case of the sentence whose predicate is a verb, I won't explain it in this post.)

1. 私は、学生です。(I'm a student.) [学生 is a noun.]
2. 彼女は、美しい。 (She is beautiful.) [美しい is an adjective.]

If you use が instead of は in those sentences, the sentence gives the different impression:
私は、学生です implies that you don't know whether other people are students or not.
私が、学生です implies that you are a only student in a group.
彼女は、美しい implies that you don't know whether other people are beautiful or not.
彼女が、美しい implies that other people are not beautiful.

In other words, if は follows the subject in the sentence whose predicate is a noun or an adjective, は have effect to eliminate other things except the subject itself. 

誰がチームのキャプテンですか? - Who is a captain of this team?
私はキャプテンです。
This answer is unnatural. You should answer "私'が'キャプテンです."



Be careful, I don't mean that a noun which is followed by は/が is the subject of the sentence.

頭が痛い。

In this sentence, the subject is 私は and it is omitted.
