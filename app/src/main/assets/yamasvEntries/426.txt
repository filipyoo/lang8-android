Agreement of Verb Tense in Japanese

I saw that children were playing in the park.
公園で子どもたちが遊んでい る のを見ました。
公園で子どもたちが遊んでい た のを見ました。
The both Japanese sentences above are correct. You can use both the past and the present tense to describe the children's actions. The former is better if you'd like to describe it as lively. 

Yesterday, I went to a park where a rose was blooming.
昨日、バラが咲いている公園に行きました。
昨日、バラが咲いていた公園に行きました。
"バラが咲いて いる/いた" are used to modify the park and two events, the rose blooms and you go to there, happened at the same time. In this case, you should say "咲いている." The second sentence sounds as if the rose withered before yesterday.

Yesterday, I visited the house where Napoleon was born.
You have to say "昨日、ナポレオンが生まれた家に行きました" in this case. "生まれる家に行きました" means that he wasn't born yet before yesterday.

Yesterday, I went to a stable to see a birth of a colt.
You have to say "昨日、子馬が生まれるのを見に馬小屋に行きました." "生まれたのを見に行きました" means that the colt was born before yesterday.
