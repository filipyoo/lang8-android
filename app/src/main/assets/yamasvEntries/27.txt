How To Enumerate Multiple Nouns By Using や or と.

You can enumerate multiple nouns by using や or と.
Example:
日本に行ったら、すし や さしみ や うどんを食べたい.
日本に行ったら、すし と さしみ と うどんを食べたい.

Even if you change the order of the listed nouns in both sentences, the meanings of them does not change.

Both have almost the same meaning but there is a slight difference of nuances between them.
The former gives us an impression that you have many food which you want to eat in Japan, especially すし, さしみ, and うどん are food which you want to eat most among them.
The latter sounds that you are not very interested in or you don't have a lot of knowledge of Japanese food without すし, さしみ, and うどん, because the と have an effect to limit something.
