Using 晴れて

晴れている means "It's sunny" or "the sky is clear."

晴れて is also used when you are officially recognized as something. It implies that you are happy.

裁判所が上告を棄却して、彼は晴れて無罪となった。
- The court rejected the appeal and his innocence was officially established.
(This sentence implies that you are happy because you believed that he was non-guilty. If his guilt was established and you said 晴れて有罪となった, it implies that you hoped he would be found guilty.)

私は試験に受かって、晴れて弁護士になった。
- I passed the test and officially became a lawyer.

私は日本国籍を取得して、晴れて日本人になった。
- I acquired Japanese nationality and officially became Japanese.

私は来月晴れてグーグルの社員になる予定だ。
- Finally, I'm going to be an employee of google next month. 


The last three sentences imply that it has been your dream.
