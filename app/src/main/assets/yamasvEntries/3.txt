Who is "自分"?

"自分" means myself.  "自分の名前はケンです" means "My name is Ken." 

By the way, how do you feel if a Japanese ask you?  "自分の名前は何ですか?"
You may think "Why he doesn't know his own name?" 

In this conversation, "自分" refer to you.  The person you are talking to is sometimes expressed as "自分" in Japanese conversation. 

"自分の名前はケンです。自分の名前は？"
This sentence may sound strange. However, we can understand this sentence. He says "My name is Ken. What's your name?"

Therefore, when you ask "ここに自分の名前を書いてください" from a receptionist at the front desk, you have to write your name. Don't write his name!


"今日は、自分の家で、テレビ見ようか?" 
You can't understand who "自分" refer to from this sentence only. However, you must know who "自分" is, because you know the speaker's habit in conversation. If you don't know each other well, the speaker wouldn't use this misleading expression.
