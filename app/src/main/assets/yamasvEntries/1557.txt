Using 〜なり

I haven't posted for almost two months because I had been busy, but I'll start again from today.


なり can follow the dictionary form of a verb to mean "as soon as."

彼は家に着くなりゲームを始めた。
- As soon as he arrived at home, he started playing a video game.

- As soon as she saw me, she started crying.

彼はその車をひと目見るなり「買う」と言った。
- He said "I'll take the car" just after glancing. 

All the sentences above describe the past events, but you can't use the past tense of the verb when なり follows it.
