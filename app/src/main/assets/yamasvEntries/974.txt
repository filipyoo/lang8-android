Using だけ and ばかり

だけ means "only."

大人だけがビールを買えます。
- Only adults can buy beer. 

言われたことだけしなさい。(余計なことはするな)
- Do only what I told you. / Don't do anything but what I told you.

この店の客は観光客だけです。
- All of the customers of this shop are tourists.


You can't use だけ when there are exceptions. On the other hand, ばかり can be used when there are exceptions.

この店の客は観光客ばかりです。
- Most of the customers of this shop are tourists.
If the percentage of tourists is more than about 75% or more, you can say ばかり. If you say 観光客だけです, it means there are no local customers at all.

彼はラーメンばかり食べている。
- He always eats ramen.
This Japanese sentence implies that he eats ramen three or more times a week. ラーメンだけ食べる means that he never eats anything but ramen. 

彼はゲームばかりしている。
- He's always playing video games.
It's unnatural to say ゲームだけしている if he goes to school or has a job.  ゲームばかりしている means that he always plays video games when he has free time. ゲームだけしている implies that he doesn't go to school and doesn't have a job, or he might be a professional video game player.
