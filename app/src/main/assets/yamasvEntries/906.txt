Using 引き取る

引き取る means to receive something you own. It sounds slightly more formal than 受け取る.

修理を頼んでいる車を日曜日に引き取る。
- I'll pick up my car on Sunday, which I asked them to fix.


It's also used to mean to get something from someone who doesn't need it.

子犬を引き取ってくれる人を探しています。
- I'm looking for homes for puppies.

そのソファを捨てる予定なら、僕が引きとるよ。
- If you are going to dispose of the couch, I'll get it. 


息を引き取る means to die.

おじいさんは昨日息を引き取りました。
- My grandfather passed away yesterday.


お引き取りください is a polite expression that means "I want you go back." You can say it to a salesperson who comes to your home to try to sell you something you don't need.
