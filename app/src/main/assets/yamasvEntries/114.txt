だらけ

It is used to describe that there are a lot of unpleasant things. It always follows a noun.

彼の部屋はゴミ だらけ だ。
His room is full of trash.

その道はデコボコ だらけ です。
The road is full of bumps and potholes.

すべての記事がウソ だらけ なので、その新聞は嫌いだ。
I hate the newspaper because all articles are filled with lies.

血 だらけ のナイフを見つけた。
I found a knife covered with blood.

泥 だらけ の手で車にさわるな。
Don’t touch my car with muddy hands.


It is a little weird to use it with positive things. (Some people may not think so.)

There are a lot of beautiful flowers in the park.
その公園はきれいな花だらけです。
