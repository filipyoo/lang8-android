The Difference Between つもりです and 予定です.

つもりです is used to express that you have intentions or will. 予定です is used to describe that you have specific plans.

For example:

You can say "東京大学に入学するつもりです" if you want to be admitted to the University of Tokyo and you are studying for the entrance exam. However, you cannot say "東京大学に入学する予定です" until you pass the entrance exam.

You can say "彼女と結婚するつもりです" if you have a plan to make the marriage proposal. However, you cannot say "彼女と結婚する予定です" until she accepts it.


( Since there is no future tense in Japanese, you don't have to use つもりです or 予定です everytime you talk about future events. "明日、学校に行きます" or "来月、日本に旅行します" are natural expressions. You should use つもりです or 予定です only when you want to stress your intentions or plans.)
