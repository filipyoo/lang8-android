Omission of a Term in Comparison

アメリカの人口は日本の人口より多い。
アメリカの人口は日本のそれより多い。
The population of America is larger than that of Japan.

Both of the two sentences above are correct, but they sound slightly lengthy. You can say "アメリカの人口は日本より多い." You don't need to say 人口 or それ after 日本 because it's implied.

You can omit the term that is surrounded by parensethis in each of the following sentences.

彼の性格は父親(の性格)に似ている。
His character is similar to that of his father.

彼の給料は私(の給料)より多い。
His salary is more than mine.

日本の気候は私達の国(の気候)とかなり違う。
Japan's climate is very different from that of our country.
