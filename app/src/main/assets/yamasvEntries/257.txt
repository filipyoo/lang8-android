The Usage of "Verbs + あげる" and "Verbs + もらう"

"Verbs + あげる" is used when someone gives help to other people. It is used to describe from the point of view of the person who gives help.

弟の宿題を手伝ってあげた - I helped my brother with his homework.
母が私の先生に料理を作ってあげた - My mother cooked for my teacher.


You can't use あげる when you receive the help or when the person who receives help is closer than the person who gives it.

o 私は、息子にその漢字を教えてあげた - I taught my son that kanji.
x 息子は、私にその漢字を教えてあげた - My son taught me that kanji.
You should say ”息子は、私にその漢字を教えてくれた."

o 息子は、私の友達にその漢字を教えてあげた - My son taught a friend of mine that kanji.
x 私の友達は、息子にその漢字を教えてあげた - A friend of mine taught my son that kanji.
You should say ”友達は、息子にその漢字を教えてくれた."


やる has the same meaning as あげる, but やる is a rude expression, therefore you should avoid using やる if you don't know the nuance of it. 
"母が私の先生に料理を作ってやった" is technically correct, but sounds very rude. It sounds as if your mother did it reluctantly.


Be careful. When you offer something to do for someone, "〜てあげましょうか？" sometimes sounds pushy. You should say "〜ましょうか？"
(It's okay to say "〜してあげようか？" to your family or friends.)

x 手伝ってあげましょうか? (Sounds pushy.)
o 手伝いましょうか? - May I help you?

x 説明してあげましょうか? (Sounds pushy.)
o 説明しましょうか? - Do you want me to explain it? / Can I explain it to you?



By contrast, "Verbs + もらう" is used when someone receives help from other people. It is used to describe from the point of view of the person who receives help.

弟の宿題を手伝ってあげた = 弟は私に宿題を手伝ってもらった。

母が私の先生に料理を作ってあげた = 先生は母に料理を作ってもらった。

Unlike くれる and あげる, you don't have to be aware of the relation between you and them who give and receive the help when you use もらう.
