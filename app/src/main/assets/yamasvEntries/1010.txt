Using 〜まい

The dictionary form of verbs + まい is used to show your negative volition or prediction. It's a slightly old-fashioned expression.

- The waiter was too rude. I'll never go to that restaurant again.

高い辞書を買おうが買うまいが、日本人相手に練習しない限り日本語の会話は上達しない。
- No matter whether you buy an expensive dictionary or not, your Japanese conversation skill won't improve as long as you don't practice with a native speaker.  

大人はマンガには夢中になるまいと思っていた。
- I didn't think that grown-up people would be into manga.

彼だけは私を裏切るまいと思っていた。
- I thought he was the last person who betray me.


When the verb before まい ends with る, the る is sometimes omitted. It depends on the conjugation of the verb.

西洋人は納豆は食べ(る)まい。 (Both 食べまい and 食べるまい are correct.)
- Westerners wouldn't eat natto.

彼はすぐには家に帰るまい。(You can't omit the る.)
- He won't go home soon.
