Using そこまで〜ない

そこまで can be used with a negative form to deny something you imagine. 

僕のノートPCのディスプレイは17インチだけど、そこまで重くない。
- My laptop has a 17 inch display, but it's not so heavy (as you imagine.)
You would think that a laptop with a 17 inch display is very heavy. The そこまで in this Japanese sentence indicates the prediction. (It doesn't say that it's very light, but says that it's not so heavy.)

日産GT-Rは世界で最もパワフルな車の１つだがそこまで高くない。
- Nissan GT-R is one of the most powerful cars in the world, but it's not so expensive. (It's not cheap, but not expensive as a Porsche or Ferarri.)

あのレストランはとても有名でいつも混んでるけど、そこまでおいしいとは思わない。
- That restaurant is very popular and always busy, but I don't think the dishes are so good as the reputation. (It's not bad, but not delicious.)
