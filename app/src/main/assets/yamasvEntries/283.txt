The Difference Between 知る and 知っている

知る doesn't mean "know" but "get new information." Therefore, "彼女の名前を知る" doesn't mean "I know her name." Rather, it means that you don't know her name and you'll learn her name now."

知る isn't an active verb but a stative verb. When ている comes after a stative verb, it doesn't represent actions but statuses. Therefore, 知っている means "know."
If you want to say "Do you know her name?", you shouldn't say "彼女の名前を知りますか?" but rather "彼女の名前を知ってますか?" 

Do you know where the bank is?
x 銀行はどこか知りますか?
o 銀行はどこか知ってますか?

Do you know who he is?
x 彼は誰か知りますか?
o 彼は誰か知ってますか?


You can say 知らない or 知りません to mean "I don't know."


When ている comes after action verbs, it means you are in the middle of doing something.

彼は走っている。
He's running.

彼は映画を観ています。
He's watching a movie.
