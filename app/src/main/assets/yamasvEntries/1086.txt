Using Single Unit to Mean "not even do something"

You can use "'a noun' + '1' + 'the counter of the noun'" in a sentence which means "not even do something." You don't have to use any particle after the counter.

彼は金持ちなのにコーヒー1杯おごってくれたことがない。
- Although he's rich, he never has even bought a cup of coffee for me.

You can usually use すら to mean "even:" コーヒーすらおごってくれたことがない. However, the 一杯 implies "even," so you can omit the すら.

- I have only 50 yen, so I can't even buy a rice ball.

- I didn't steal anything.

- Even single person didn't notice it.


You can also use the stem of suru-verb. Since they don't have the counter, you can say １つ in this case.

- He's too shy to even introduce himself.
