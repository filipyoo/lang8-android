The Usage of "どっちもどっち" and "甲乙つけがたい"

Both "どっちもどっち" and "甲乙(こうおつ)つけがたい" are used when you can't determine which is better than the other after comparing two things. However, the two phrases have completely different nuances.

"どっちもどっち" is used when the two things are not good for you. On the other hand, "甲乙つけがたい" is used when the two things are excellent.


この二台の車は、燃費が悪いしパワーも足りないし、どっちもどっちだ。
I don't like either of these two cars because they are gas eaters and don't have enough power.

メルセデスとBMWは、どちらも素晴らしい車で甲乙つけがたい。
I can't determine which is better, Mercedes or BMW. Both are excellent.
