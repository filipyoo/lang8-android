Using いい勝負

いい勝負 means "a nice game/match."

決勝戦はいい勝負だった。すごく興奮した。
- The final match was awesome. I was very excited.


It's also used to compare two things that have nothing to do with a match.

このお好み焼きはすごくおいしい。ナポリで食べたピザといい勝負だ。
- This okonomiyaki is delicious. I can't say which is better, this one or pizza I had in Napoli.

東京の夜景は素晴らしい。ニューヨークといい勝負だ。
- The night view of Tokyo is wonderful. It reminds me New York.


Since it just means that two things are at the same level, you also use it to compare two bad things.

彼の英語はひどくて何を言ってるのかまったくわからない。僕の日本語といい勝負だ。
- His English is very bad. I can't understand what he's saying at all. It's as bad as my Japanese.

彼の靴はすごく臭い。腐った生ごみといい勝負だ。
- His shoes are really whiffy. They smell like rotten garbage.
