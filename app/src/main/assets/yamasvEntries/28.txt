とか.

You can list multiple nouns by using とか as in the case of using や or と.
Example:
日本に行ったら、すし と さしみ と うどんを食べたい.  
日本に行ったら、すし や さしみ や うどんを食べたい.
日本に行ったら、すし とか さしみ とか うどんを食べたい. - (1)

"すし とか さしみ" gives an impression that you know a lot of Japanese food than "すし や さしみ."

You can list nouns in any orders as you like, the order of nouns has no meanings. It is the same as in the case of using や or と.

とか has a unique rule that differs from や and と.
You can leave the last とか.
"A とか B とか C とか が好き" and "A とか B とか C が好き" are correct sentences. The former sounds like you want to list many other nouns. Many Japanese people may like the former.

You can't say "A と B と C と が好き", you need to say "A と B と C が好き."　
Similarly, You can't say "A や B や C や が好き", you need to say "A や B や C が好き."　


とか has an interesting usage. I will show you an example before explanations.

Tom. 何か日本の食べ物のおすすめはある? - Do you have any recommendations of Japanese food?
Ken. すしとか.

You may have a feeling that Ken will continue other words after とか, but he won't. What he wanted to say is すしとかはどうですか? ("How about sushi?").
We sometimes omit the rest of the sentence after とか.
You can say like the following instead of (1). 
日本に行ったら、いろんなものを食べたい、すし とか さしみ とか うどん とか.

When your conversation partner says nothing after とか, you need to realize that it's your turn to say something.
