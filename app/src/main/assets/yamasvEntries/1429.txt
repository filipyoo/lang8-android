How to Say "Who wants to 〜?" in Japanese

"誰が〜たいですか?" is grammatically correct, but sounds unnatural. "〜たい人はいますか?" sounds natural.

日本に行きたい人はいますか？
- Who wants to go to Japan?

ピザを食べたい人はいる？
- Who wants to eat pizza?

You can omit the phrase after 人 in a casual situation.
日本に行きたい人?
ピザを食べたい人?
In this case, you don't need to use a rising intonation.

If you are one of the listeners and you want to do it, you can say "〜たい." "私です" sounds unnatural.

ディズニーランドに行きたい人？
行きたい!
- Who wants to go to the Disney Land?
- I do!
