Using どう?

"最近、どう？" means "How is it going?," which is used when you see your friend for the first time in a few weeks. It's unnatural to say it to someone you see almost every day. It's just a greeting, so you don't need to answer seriously.

If you just say "どう?," it implies that you are asking about something specific, and the listener understands what you are asking about. For example, if you are doing very important job, your boss might just ask "どう?" In this case, you need to explain the situation seriously.
Or, if your friend had a job interview, you can just say "どうだった?" to mean "How did it go?"

If you often go drinking with someone and they ask you "今夜、どう?" it means "Why don't you go drinking with me tonight?"

If you like golf and your friend says "日曜日、どう?" pretending to swing a golf club, it means "Why don't you go golfing next Sunday?"

If someone holds out snacks or something and say "良かったらどう?," it means "please have some." It's a casual version of "良かったらどうぞ."
