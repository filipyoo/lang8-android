How to Say "What makes X Y?" in Japanese

"何がXをYにしている?” is a literal translation of "What makes X Y?" However, it doesn't sound natural; なぜ, なんで in a casual conversation, sounds natural in many cases.

なんでこの料理は美味しいの？
- What makes the dish delicious?

なんで怒ってるの？
- What makes you angry?

なんで日本に行きたいの？
- What makes you want to visit Japan?

なんでそう思うの？
- What makes you think so?

なんで僕のPCは遅いのだろう？
- What makes my PC slow?

なんで日本語を勉強しているの？
- What makes you study Japanese?


You can also use なぜ/なんで to say:

What brings you to Japan? - なんで日本に来たの?

What takes you so long? - なんでそんなに時間がかかってるの？

How did you know? - なんで知ってるの？

How did you fail? - なんで失敗したの?


I've heard that if you use "why" in these types of questions, it could sound as if you are blaming the listener. However, なぜ/なんで itself doesn't have the nuance; it depends on the tone of your voice.
