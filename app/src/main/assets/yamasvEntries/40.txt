どうぞ / どうか

どうぞ is used when you offer someone something, which is the benefit of the listener.
お先に　どうぞ - After you.
ケーキを　どうぞ - Here's your cake.
どうぞ　ごゆっくり - Take your time.

On the other hand you can use どうか when you ask someone to do something, which is not a benefit of the listener.

どうか、許してください - Please forgive me.
どうか、お金を貸してください - Please loan me some money.
どうか、命だけは助けてください - Take all the money I have, but spare my life.


You should say "どうぞ、食べてください" when you treat your guests to your handmade cooking. If you say "どうか、食べてください", they may think you are trying to let them eat terrible food.



("どうぞ, お召し上がり下さい" is more polite expression.)
