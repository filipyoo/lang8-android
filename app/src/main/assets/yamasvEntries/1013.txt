Using 〜がかりで and かかりきり

〜がかりで is used to describe how many people or how long time were needed to do something. It's mainly used to stress that it was a hard work.

５人がかりでそのテーブルを動かした。
- It took five people to move the table. 

５年がかりでこの製品を開発した。
- It took us five years to develop this product.


かかる can be also used for a price:

車を修理するのに５万円かかった。- It took 50,000 yen to fix my car.

However, がかりで can't follow a price. 五万円がかりで車を修理した is incorrect.



かかりきり means to do nothing but something.

彼は最近その研究にかかりきりだ。
- Lately, he does nothing but the research.

彼女は双子にかかりきりだ。
- She has to take care of her twins, and has no free time.
