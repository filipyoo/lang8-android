How to Say "You are supposed to" in Japanese

When you are talking about obligation or the rules you should follow, you can say "いけない."

お葬式には黒いネクタイをしないといけない。
- You are supposed to wear a black tie in a funeral.

赤信号の時は渡ってはいけない。
- You are not supposed to walk when the signal is red.

3月末までに税金を払わないといけない。
- You are supposed to pay taxes by the end of March.



When you are talking about your plan, you can say ことになっている or はずだ.

彼はその打ち合せに参加することになっている。
彼はその打ち合せに参加するはずだ。
- He is supposed to attend the meeting.

私は来月日本に転勤することになっている。
- I'm supposed to be transferred to Japan next month.
(When you are talking about yourself, はずだ sounds slightly unnatural.)

はずだった means "you were supposed to." It implies "but you didn't." If you say ことになっていた instead of はずだった, it's slightly ambiguous whether you did or not.

彼はその打ち合せに参加するはずだった(が参観しなかった)。
- He was supposed to attend the meeting(, but he didn't).

私は先月日本に転勤することになっていた(が転勤しなかった)。
- I was supposed to be transferred to Japan last month(, but I didn't).



When you are talking about a common sense or something everyone believes, you can say ものだ.

クリスマスは家族と一緒に過ごすものだ。
- You are supposed to spend Christmas with your family.

犬は賢いものだ。
- Dogs are supposed to be smart.



Finally, I'll share common phrases with you.

What am I supposed to do?
- 何をすればいいわけ？ (It implies "I don't understand what you want me to do.")
- どうすればいいの? (It implies "I don't know what to do.")

How am I supposed to know?
- なんで私が知ってるの？ (It implies "I don't know.")
