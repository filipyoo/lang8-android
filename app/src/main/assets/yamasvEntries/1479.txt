Using 良く/悪く 言えば

良く言えば means to express something in a good way; 悪く言えば is the opposite. It's used when you can estimate something from two different point of views.

彼は良く言えば純粋だが、悪く言えば子供っぽい。
- You could say that he's pure in a good way, but you could also say that he's childish in a bad way.

この料理は良く言えば濃厚だが、悪く言えばしつこい。
- This dish is rich at best, heavy at worst.

彼女は良く言えば面倒見がいいが、悪く言えばおせっかいだ。
- On the one hand she is helpful, but on the other hand she is meddling.


You can omit the one side view because the other one is implied. For example, only by saying 彼は良く言えば純粋だ, it's implied that you also have a negative impression of him. Similarly, 彼は悪く言えば子供っぽい itself implies that it also has the positive side at the same time.
