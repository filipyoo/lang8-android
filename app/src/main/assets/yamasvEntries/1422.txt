Using 〜までだ

までだ can follow a verb. When it follows the dictionary form of verbs, it's used to describe what you will do and implies that you don't have to think about anything else.

持っている株が下がったら売るまでだ。
- If the stock I have fell,  I'd sell it. That's all.

たとえ君が辞めても別な人を雇うまでだ。
- Even if you quit the job, it wouldn't bother us. All we have to do is to hire another person. 

たとえ首になってもあたらしい仕事を探すまでだ。心配することはない。
- Even if they fired me, I'd find another job. You don't have to worry about it.


When it follows the past form of verbs, it's used to say that the action doesn't mean much. It's the same as だけだ, but slightly sounds formal.

当然のことをしたまでです。
- I just did the right thing.

ちょっと聞いたまでです。
- I just asked. It's nothing.

挨拶にちょっと寄ったまでですので、おかまいなく。
- Please don't go to any trouble for me. I just dropped by to say hello.
