How to Say "must" and "have to" in Japanese

Many Japanese people don't know the difference of nuance between "must" and "have to" because we learn that both "must" and "have to" are translated into "なければならない/ないといけない."

きれいになるために痩せないといけない。
- I must lose weight to be beautiful.

膝が悪いから痩せないといけない。
- I have to lose weight because I have knee problems.

If you want to stress that you don't like to do it, but you have no choice, you can say せざるを得ない.

手術でお金が必要だから、家を売らざるを得ない。
- I have to sell my house because I need money for the surgeon.

車が壊れたから家まで歩かざるを得なかった。
- I had to walk to my house because my car was broken down.


The Japanese translations of the negative form of them are completely different. "Mustn't" would be translated into "てはいけない," and "don't have to" would be translated into "なくていい" or "する必要はない." "する必要はない" sounds slightly more formal.

"XXXX"はとても失礼に聞こえるから、言ってはいけない。
- You mustn't say "XXXX" because it's sounds very rude.

その意味は含まれてるから、わざわざ"XXXX"と言わなくていい / 言う必要はない。
- You don't have to say "XXXX" explicitly because it's implied.

日本ではチップを払わなくていい / 払う必要はない。
- You don't have to pay a tip in Japan.
