The Difference Between "〜より〜" and "〜よりは〜."

僕のクルマは君のBMWより安い。
This Japanese sentence means "My car is cheaper than your BMW." It doesn't imply anything but that. If the price of the BMW is ten million dollars, that of the speaker's car might be nine million dollars or might be one million dollar.

僕のクルマは君のBMWより"は"安い。
This sentence also means "My car is cheaper than your BMW," but, at the same time, it implies that the prices are very close to each other. You can guess that the price would be about eight or nine million dollars.
When は follows より in a comparing sentence, it implies that there are no major differences between the two.


あの選手はボルトよりは遅い。
It means that the athlete can't run faster than Bolt, but can run very fast like him.

インドの人口は中国よりは少ない。
- The population of India is large, but smaller than that of China.

アメリカの人口は中国よりは少ない。
This sentence sounds a little unnatural because the population of America is large, but is much less than that of China.


僕は君よりは背が高い。
- I'm taller than you, but both of us are short.
When a positive expression follows よりは, it implies that both aren't good. Therefore, you can know that both are short from this sentence, even if you don't know how tall they are.

この店の料理は妻の料理よりはおいしい。
- The dishes in this restaurant aren't good, but better than my wife's cooking.

You can also say "妻の料理よりましだ."  "〜よりまし" means "better than 〜" and implies that both of them aren't good. You can't use it when one or both of them are good.
