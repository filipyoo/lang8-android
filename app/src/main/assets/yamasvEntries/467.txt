Past Tense and Perfect Tense in Japanese

There is no gramattical difference between the past tense and perfect tense of verbs in Japanese. You can always use the タ-form. 

Have you already eatern lunch? - もう昼食は食べた?
Did you eat lunch yesterday? - 昨日昼食は食べた?
Affirmative answers for the both questions are the same. You can say "食べた." However, negative answers aren't the same. Since the first one isn't a question for past events, you can't say "食べなかった." You have to say "食べてない."  You can say both "食べなかった" and "食べてない" as a negative answer to the second question. ("食べなかった" sounds slightly more natural.)

Did you go to school yesterday? - 昨日学校に行った?
If you were supposed to go, "行かなかった" sound natural as a negative answer to it. On the other hand, "行ってない" sounds more natural if you were not supposed to go.

Did you steal my money? - 私のお金を盗んだ？
You shouldn't say "盗まなかった." It sounds as if you tried to steal. 


When the タ-form is used as the perfect tense, it is used to mean that the action has complteted psychologically. For example, when we are waiting for a bus at a bus stop, we say "バスが来た" when we see the bus despite the bus hasn't arrived at the bus stop. We don't say "バスが来る" after we see the bus. We consider that the action "バスが来る" has completed when we see the bus.
