Using 甲乙つけがたい

In the past, 甲 and 乙 were used when a teacher grade student's skill. (甲 means "good" and 乙 means "not so good.")  They are not used to grade something in these days, but 甲乙つけがたい is often used even now. 甲乙つけがたい are used when you can't judge which is better than another because both are excellent.
