Using 来る

来る is a confusing verb. First, the pronunciation is odd. The kanji is pronounced different ways, according to the conjugation.

来ない　こない
来ます　きます
来る　　くる
来れば　くれば
来い　　こい


Second, 来る and "to come" are not the same. 

- Please come to my house. 私の家に来てください。
- I'll come. 来ます。
This answer is wrong. When you say "to come" in Japanese, you need to choose the verb from the speaker's point of view, not from the listener's point of view. Therefore, you need to say "行きます" in this case.

If you are at the listener's house now, you can say "明日もこの家に来ます" to mean "I'll come here tomorrow again," but if you are not, you need to say "明日もその家に行きます (I'll come to your house tomorrow again.)"


"He will come."
If you are where he will come, you can say 彼は来ます. If the listener is where he will come and you are not, you can say both 彼は来ます and 彼は行きます. If you are talking from the listener's point of view, you can say the former. On the other hand, if you were more familiar with him than the listener, you would talk from his point of view and say the latter.
