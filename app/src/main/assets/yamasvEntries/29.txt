How To Ask Someone For Help Or Proffer Help For Someone.

When you ask someone to help you with a little job like your homework or cooking, You can say "手伝ってください."
Since "助けてください" sounds as if you had a serious problem, you should not say that in this case.
"手伝ってください" is a polite expression, you can say "手伝って" to your friends or your family.

When you proffer help to someone, you can say "手伝いましょうか?"
"助けましょうか?" is unnatural when they don't have a big problem. If they really have a big problem, you can not have a enough time to say that.
"手伝いましょうか?" is a polite expression, you can say "手伝おうか?" to your friends or your family.


There is an interesting rule when you thank to their offer. 

宿題を手伝おうか? - Can I help your homework?
ありがとう。助かる。- Thank you。It's a great help.

You should say "助かる" even if they said "手伝おうか?"
We never say "手伝われる" in this case.
