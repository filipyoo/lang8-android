The Difference Between きっと and かならず

1.
きっと and かならず are used to describe confident guesses. However, きっと is used when expressing your confidence based on subjective judgement while かならず is used to express your confidence based on objective judgement.

I know you will pass the exam.
あなたは、きっと試験にパスできます。
あなたは、かならず試験にパスできます。

"きっと試験にパスできます" implies that the speaker doesn't have the proof.
If the pass is backed by the objective data, you should use かならず in this case. 
(かならず is sometimes used to just encourage the student even if you don't have the proof.)


If you were a surgeon, you shouldn't say "手術はきっと成功します(The operation will succeed)." You have to say "手術はかならず成功します," otherwise the patient would become anxious.
