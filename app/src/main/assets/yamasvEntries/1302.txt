Using いささか and しこたま

いささか means "a little." It sounds formal and a little old-fashioned. It's mainly used to express your subjective feeling.

これはいささか古い表現です。
- This is a little old-fashioned expression.

いささか早く着きすぎたようだ。
- We seem to arrive a little earlier.

私はいささかも間違ったことは言っていない。
- I didn't say anything wrong at all.

(In a casual conversation, you should use 少し instead in all the sentences above.)


しこたま means "a lot” or "strongly." It's also used to express something subjectively. It's originally a dialect, so some Japanese people may not use it at all.

昨夜はしこたま酒を飲んだ。
- I drank a lot last night.

親父のPCを壊したのがばれて、しこたま怒られた。
- My dad found out that I broke his PC, and scolded me a lot.

机に足をしこたまぶつけてすごく痛い。折れてるかも。
- I hit my leg hard on the desk and it's very hurting me. It might be broken.
