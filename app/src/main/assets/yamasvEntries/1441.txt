見える or 見られる

Can you see Mt. Fuji over there?
むこうの富士山が見られますか?

This Japanese sentence sounds weird. You should say 見えますか instead of 見られますか.

Generally, when you want to say "can see," you should say 見える. On the other hand, when you want to say "can watch," you should say 見られる. (観る is more appropriate to write "to watch," but 見る is also acceptable. Some Japanese people don't distinguish them.)
