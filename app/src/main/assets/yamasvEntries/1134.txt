How to Say "if anything" in Japanese

You can say "それどころか" to mean "if anything," which is used to suggest the opposite of something previously implied.

もう8時だ。お腹すいたでしょう？
いや、それどころか昼ごはんをたっぷり食べたから全然食欲が無い。
- It's already 8 o'clock. You must be hungry.
- No. If anything, I don't have an appetite at all because I had a big lunch.

僕の日本語は全然上達していない。それどころか、下手になってきている。
- My Japanese hasn't improved at all. If anything, it's getting worse and worse.

その怪我は彼のパフォーマンスに影響は与えなかった。それどころか、彼は普段よりうまくプレーした。
- The injury didn't affect his performance. If anything, he played better than usual.


You can also say むしろ or かえって instead.
