でした/だった in a Tag Question

You can use でした/だった, which is the past form of です/だ, in a tag question even when you are asking about a current or future situation.

あなたは日本人でしたよね？
This sentence could imply that the speaker is thinking that the listener was Japanese before and isn't now. However, you can also say it to mean "You are Japanese, right? ("あなたは日本人ですよね?" in Japanese.) The tag question which uses でした might sound as if you are less sure, but there is no major difference between "日本人でしたよね?" and "日本人ですよね?" (日本人でしたよね might sound a little more polite.)

結婚式は明日でしたよね？
結婚式は明日ですよね？
- The wedding will be tomorrow, right?

私が彼をインタビューするんですよね？
- I'm supposed to interview him, right?

パスワードはABCでしたよね？
パスワードはABCですよね？
- The password is "ABC," isn't it?


Conversely, you can use です even when you are asking about the past event.

先週日本に行ったんですよね？
- You went to Japan last week, didn't you?
