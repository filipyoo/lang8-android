Japanese Passive Form and Potential Form of Verbs

The passive form and the potential form of a verb are the same in some cases. 食べられる is the passive form of 食べる and is also the potential form.

ケーキを弟に食べられた。
My cake was eaten by my brother.

あの大きいケーキを弟が一人で食べられたとは思えない。
I don't think that my brother was able to eat that large cake all by himself.

By the way, some Japanese people say 食べれる instead of 食べられる when it's used as the potential form. That's called "ら抜き言葉" because ら is omitted. Many textbooks say that it's technically incorrect. However, some people claim that omitting ら in potential form is fine because it's mistakable that the passive form and the potential form are the same. I think this claim has a point. Omitting ら in the potential form might become common in the near future.

Here are other examples of ら抜き言葉. (られる is technically correct. However, many Japanese people omit the ら in these verbs.)
出れる - 出られる
来れる - 来られる
着れる - 着られる
