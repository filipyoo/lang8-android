Using とっくに

とっくに is used to stress that you've done something a long time ago.

宿題は終わったの？
とっくに終わったよ。
- Have you finished your homework?
- I had done it a long time ago.

彼は才能があるのにまじめに練習しない。まじめに練習していたら、とっくにプロになってただろう。
- He's gifted, but he doesn't practice hard. If he had been practicing hard, he could have become a professional player a long time ago. 


It's also used when something is too late.

決勝戦は何時から？待ちきれないよ。
とっくに終わってるよ。
- What time will the final match start? I can't wait!
- It ended already.
(You can say like this even if it ended five minutes ago.)

両親が結婚祝いにくれたワインを今夜は飲もうか？
ごめんなさい、あれならとっくに１人で飲んじゃった。
- Why don't we drink the wine tonight my parents gave us as our wedding gift.
- I'm sorry, but I finished that already by myself.
