Using もう

When もう is used with the ta-form of verbs, it means "already."

もう宿題は終わった。
- I've already finished my homework.

もう朝食は食べた。
- I already ate breakfast.


When something will happen soon, もう is used with the dictionary form of verbs. It's similar to もうすぐ. However, in my opinion, もうすぐ sounds the same as "soon" and もう sounds the same as "now."

宿題は終わった? - Did you finish your homework?
もう終わる。- I've almost finished.  

いつまでここにいるの？- How long will you stay here?
もう帰る。- I'll go home now.


When もう is used in a negative form, it means "no more."

もう飲めない。
- I can't drink any more.

もう彼とは出かけない。
- I won't go out with him again.
