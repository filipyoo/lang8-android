How to Say "How have you been?" casually in Japanese

"どうしてた?" is a natural and casual way to say "How have you been?," when you see your friends you haven't seen for a while. 

"最近どうしてる?" is used to ask about the recent situation, while "どうしてた?" is used to ask about what happened from when you saw them last time until now.


You can use 最近 or このところ to say what you have been doing lately.

最近 / このところ 日本語の勉強を頑張っている。
- I've been studying Japanese hard.

最近 / このところ 体を鍛えている。
- I've been working out.

最近 / このところ 出かけてない。
- I haven't been going out.


このところ slightly sounds unnatural in a question form; you should use 最近.

最近どこで遊んでるの？
- Where have you been going out?

最近マンガ読んでる？
- Have you been reading manga?


最近 can be used to mean both "lately" and "recently," so some Japanese people, including me, sometimes confuse them.

最近、彼と会った。
- I recently met him. 

最近、忙しい。
- I've been busy lately.


このところ means "lately," so you can't use it to describe an event; you can say "このところ忙しい," but you can't say "このところ彼と会った."
