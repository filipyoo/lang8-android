The ta-form of verbs doesn't always mean the past.

Technically, the ta-form of verbs doesn't mean the past. It's used to mean that an action has finished.
I'll share some examples where the ta-form is used even though the action doesn't mean the past. These may confuse beginners.

昼食を食べた後で買い物に行く。
- I'm going shopping after lunch.
The main clause of this sentence is "買い物に行く." The main action is going to be done after lunch, so you have to say "食べた後." "食べる後" is incorrect. 

昼食を食べる前に買い物に行った。
- I went shopping before lunch.
On the other hand, The main clause of this sentence is also 買い物に行った, and the main action was done before lunch. Therefore, you have to say "食べる前." 
Whether you use the ta-form or not in a sub clause depends on the main clause; it doesn't depend on whether it's the past or not.



彼が来た! - He is coming!
You can say "彼が来た" when you are waiting for him and you see he is coming (even though that he hasn't arrived at where you are).
"彼が来る" is mainly used when he is supposed to come, but you haven't seen him yet. 



鍵は持った? - Are you sure you have the key?
The speaker isn't asking about the past. They are asking whether you have the key or not NOW.



長生きしたいなら、タバコをやめたほうがいい。
- You should give up smoking if you want to live long.
When you recommend something, the ta-form is often used. Using the dictionary form, for example タバコをやめるほうがいい, sounds unnatural. The dictionary form with ほうがいい is mainly used to describe which you prefer.

映画を観るより、ゲームをする方がいい。
- I prefer playing video games to watching a movie.
(ゲームをした方がいい sounds as if you are recommending someone to play video games.)
