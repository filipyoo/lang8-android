Subject omission in Japanese.


Japanese people often omit 私は in conversation. Most Japanese people would omit 私は when they talk about their own emotions or senses in casual conversations.

あなたと会えてうれしい - I'm glad to meet you.
頭が痛い - I have a headache.

The words which express your emotions like 楽しい, うれしい, 悲しい, and so on and the words which express your senses like 痛い, 眠い, and so on can be used only to describe the speakers emotions or senses.

You can't use those words to describe someone else's emotions or senses.
x 弟はあなたと会えてうれしい。
x 弟は頭が痛い。

When you talk about someone else, you have to say like this:
うれしそうだ, うれしがっている, うれしいようだ, うれしいんだろう, etc...
痛そうだ, 痛がっている, 痛いようだ, 痛いんだろう, etc...


Therefore, you can know the subject of the sentence when those words are used.

昨日、弟と遊んだ時、楽しかった。
昨日、弟と遊んだ時、楽しそうだった。

In the first sentence, you can easily know that the speaker felt happy. Similarly, you can easily know that the speaker's brother seemed to feel happy, in the second sentence.

昨日、弟と遊んだ時、楽しかった - I felt happy when I played with my brother yesterday.
昨日、弟と遊んだ時、楽しそうだった - My brother seemed to feel happy when we played together yesterday.

These two sentences sound very natural. "昨日、弟と遊んだ時、弟は楽しそうだった" sounds lengthy for us.
