A Documentary Film About Japan

I happened to find an interesting documentary film about Japan through eyes of foreigners who live in Japan for a long time. I enjoyed it and I think you, who are interested in Japan, would also enjoy it. Since it contains Japanese subtitles, it would also help you to study Japanese.
