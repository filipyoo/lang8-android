Using ただでさえ

ただ(無料) means "free," so タダで means "for free." It's often usually written in katakana.

私は弁当屋でバイトしていて、売れ残ったらタダで１つ弁当がもらえる。
- I work a part time job for a bento shop, and I can get a bento for free if they are unsold.
(バイト is a short version アルバイト, which means "a part time job." The short version is more common among young people.)


ただでさえ means "〜 enough already." This ただ has nothing to do with 無料.

彼はただでさえ金持ちなのに、叔父から莫大な遺産を相続する予定だ。フェアじゃないね。
- He's rich enough already, and is going to get a huge inheritance from his uncle. It's not fair.

ただでさえ貧乏なのに、給料を減らされた。その給料じゃやっていけない。
- I'm poor enough already, and they reduced my salary. I can't live on the salary.

家賃がただでさえ高いのに、さらに値上げされる。引っ越さないといけない。
- The rent is expensive enough already, and they are going to raise it. I have to move.

彼はただでさえすごく頭がいい上に、誰よりも勉強している。博士号を２つ持っているのも理解できる。
- He's very smart enough already, and studies harder than anyone else. No wonder he has two PhD degrees. 

(博士 is pronounced as はくし when it indicates a PhD degree. When it pronounced as はかせ, it indicates someone who knows everything about something. For example, マンガ博士 means someone who knows everything about manga, and 鉄道博士 means someone who knows everything about trains.)
