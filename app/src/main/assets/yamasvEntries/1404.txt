Using だって

When だって is placed at the beginning of a sentence, it means "because." It sounds a little childish.

今日は買い物に行きたくない。だってすごく疲れているから。
- I don't want to go shopping today because I'm very tired.


It's also used to report hearsay in a casual conversation; ん is placed between the sentence describing the hearsay and it.

市長は辞めるんだって。
- They say that the mayor is stepping down.

イギリスの投票は離脱派が勝ったんだって。
- I heard that Leave won in the UK vote.


When it follows a noun, it means "also/too." だって sounds more casual than も.

ズルをしたのは僕だけじゃない。彼だってやった。
- I'm not the only one who cheated. He did too.

日本だけでなく、イギリスやオーストラリアだって車は左側通行だ。
- Cars keep the left side on the street not only in Japan, but also in some countries such as England or Australia, .


It's also used to mean "even" when it follows a noun.

小さい子だってそれは分かる。
- Even little kids can understand it.

豚だってそんな臭い食べ物は食べない。
- Even pigs don't eat such a stinking food.
