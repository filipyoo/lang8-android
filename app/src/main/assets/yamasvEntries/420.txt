How to describe someone else's feelings in Japanese

うれしい! - I'm happy.
悲しい - I'm sad.
どこか行きたい - I'd like to go somewhere else.

You can't use the above expressions to describe another person's feelings.
x 彼はうれしい.
x 彼は悲しい.
x 彼はどこか行きたい

You have to use そうだ in these cases.
o 彼はうれしそうだ - He looks happy.
o 彼は悲しそうだ - He looks sad.
o 彼はどこか行きたそうだ - He wants to go somewhere else.

If he looks normal but you know he has other feelings or thoughts, you can use のだろう to describe his real feelings or thoughts. んだろう is often used instead of のだろう. "〜に違いない" is a formal expression of it.

He doesn't look it, but he must be happy at heart. 
- 彼はうれしそうに見えないけど、本当はうれしいのだろう.

He acts as if he feels nothing, but he must feel so sad.
- 彼はなんともないように振る舞ってるけど、心の中ではすごく悲しいんだろう.

He doesn't talk about it with me at all, but I know he wants to go somewhere else.
- 彼は言葉には出さないけど、どこかに行きたいに違いない。
