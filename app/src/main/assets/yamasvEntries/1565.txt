How to Say "Do you want me to 〜 ?" in Japanese

You can use the volitional form of a verb + か? to mean "Do you want me to 〜?" in a casual conversation. You should use rising intonation when you are not sure whether the listener want you to do it or not. If it's clear that the listener does, you should use the flat one.

家まで車で送ろうか?
- Do you want me to drive you your home?

一緒に行こうか?
- Do you want me to go with you?


In a formal situation, you should use "ましょうか?" with the masu stem of a verb.

手伝いましょうか?
- Would you like me to help you?

冷たいものを持ってきましょうか?
- Would you like me to bring you something cold to drink?


These two types of expressions are also used to ask/recommend something. In this case, you shouldn't use rising intonation.
