Using 巻き込まれる


"He was involved in the crime."

It's my understanding that you can't know whether he is one of the assailant or the victim of the crime by just reading this English sentence.
In Japanese, you can say "彼はその犯罪に巻き込まれた" if he was the victim of the crime. On the other hand, you can say "彼はその犯罪に関わっていた" if he was the assailant of the crime.
"巻き込まれる" is used when you have a trouble and "関わる" is used when you do it with purpose.

- I was late because I was involved in a traffic jam.

二人の子供が交通事故に巻き込まれて怪我をした。
- Two children were injured by being involved in a traffic accident.
