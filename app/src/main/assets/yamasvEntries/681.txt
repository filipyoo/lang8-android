Common Mistakes About します and あります

I have a job interview today.
今日面接をします/やります is correct if you are an interviewer, but if you are an interviewee, you should say "面接があります" or "面接を受けます."

A teacher can say "テストをします/やります," but a student can't. A student should say "テストがあります" or "テストを受けます."

"9月から学校を始めます" is also incorrect if you are a student. It sounds as if you are the owner of the school and you can decide when the school will start. You should say "9月から学校が始まります."

"9月から仕事を始めます" is correct if you have decided that you'll start the job on September.
