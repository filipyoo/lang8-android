Using 〜たまで

The ta-form of verbs + まで is used when what you did had no other intentions. It's the same as "〜ただけ," but sounds slightly more formal. 

本当のことを言ったまでです。
- I just told you the truth. 

一般論を述べたまでだ。具体的な問題に言及したわけじゃない。
- I just described a generalization. I didn't refer to a particular issue.

彼が言ったことを伝えたまでだ。私の意見じゃない。
- I just told you what he said. It's not my own opinion.


It's mainly used when the listener is misunderstanding your intention. For instance, "本当のことを言ったまでです" is a common phrase used when the listener is thinking that what you said is a subjective and biased opinion.
