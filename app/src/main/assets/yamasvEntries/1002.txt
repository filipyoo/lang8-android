Using 〜でも

When でも follows a noun, it means "〜 or something."

映画でも見に行きませんか?
- Would you like to go to a movie or something?

This sentence doesn't imply that the speaker really want to watch a movie; they are just suggesting a way to enjoy free time. Therefore, you can suggest other things, such as  "ボーリングの方がいい(I'd  rather like to play bowling)" or "買い物に行きたい(I'd rather like to go shopping.)"

On the other hand, if they say "映画を見に行きませんか," it implies that they really want to watch a movie, probably they have a movie they want to watch, so "ボーリングのほうがいい" may sound unnatural. You should answer yes/no this case.




顔があざだらけだよ。ケンカでもした？
- You have bruises all over your face. Did you have a fight or something?

今日は何もすることがない。ゲームでもしてひまをつぶすよ。
- I have nothing to do today. I'll play video games or something to kill time.

彼は立派な体をしていてすごく強そうだ。柔道でもやってるんだろう。
- He has a muscular body and looks very strong. He must be a judo player or something.

温泉にでも行きたい。
- I'd like to go to a hot springs or something.
(The に before でも can't be omitted in this case.)
