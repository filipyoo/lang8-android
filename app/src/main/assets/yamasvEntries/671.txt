Using 〜にも and 〜にでも

When 〜にも follows a date/time, it's used to show the earliest date/time in case everything goes well/bad.

(早ければ/うまくいけば)９月にもその会社はニューヨーク証券取引所に上場するだろう。
- That company will list on the New York Stock Exchange in September if everything goes well.
(You can omit 早ければ/うまくいけば because にも implies it.)

彼らがすぐに供給してくれなければ、在庫は金曜日にもなくなる。
- Our stocks will run out as early as Friday if they won't supply them soon.


〜にでも is used when you do the action. You can't use にでも in the sentence above because the person who do the action isn't the speaker.

孫に会えるなら、今すぐにでもアメリカに行きたい。
- We want to go to America right now if we can see our grandchildren.

今度の日曜日にでも、車を洗う。
- I'll wash my car on next Sunday if I'll feel like it.
(This Japanese sentence implies that the speaker may change the plan with ease if they won't feel like it.)

If someone told you that "午後 にでも 君の家に行くよ(I'll come to your house this afternoon if I can,)" you should understand that the 午後 is just an example. It doesn't mean that they break the promise if they'll come three days later.
