Using 水

水 means water. It's always used to refer to cold water. When you refer to hot water, you need to say お湯. 熱い水 doesn't make sense. 

このシャワーは水しか出ない。
- This shower only put out cold water.

お湯を注ぐだけでスープが作れます。
- You can make a soup only by pouring hot water.

熱いお湯 means very hot water, over about 80 degree Centigrade. 沸騰したお湯 means boiling water. 
If someone says that "冷たい水をください," you should serve them water with ice cubes, not at normal temperature.
