The difference between この〜, その〜, and あの〜.

I will explain the difference between この人, その人, and あの人.
First, I will explain in the situation when you are talking about a person who is there. この人 means a person who is near to you, その人 means a person who is near to the listener, and あの人 means a person who is away from two of you. 

Second, I will explain in the situation when you are talking about a person who is not there. You can’t use この人 in this situation. あの人 is used when both you and a partner know the person. その人 is used only one of you know about the person. Therefore, if you tweet on Twitter like this “今、面白い人を見ました。あの人は夏なのにコートを着ていました。(I saw a funny man now, he wore a coat in the summer.) ,” it sounds unnatural because almost all followers of you don’t know the man. You should use その人 in this case.
Of course, you can apply this rule to other things.
Here is a conversation to explain this rule.
X:「昨日　”セブン”っていう映画を見た。」( I watched a movie titled “Seven.”)
Y:「その映画、面白かった？」(Did you enjoy it?)
Z:「あの映画、面白かった？」
This conversation implies Y and Z haven’t watched the movie yet. Furthermore, you can understand that Y doesn’t know it at all but Z know it a little, because Y use その and Z use あの.  Z may have watched the trailer of it.


(I used この人/その人/あの人 to explain the difference between them, but they are a little rude expressions, you should use こちらの方/そちらの方/あちらの方 in formal situation.)
